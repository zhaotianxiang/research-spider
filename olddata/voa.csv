,"A pro-democracy Hong Kong radio DJ was convicted of seditious speech on Wednesday under a British colonial-era law that authorities have embraced as China flattens dissent in the business hub.,Tam Tak-chi, 49, is among a growing number of activists charged with sedition, a previously little-used law that prosecutors have dusted off in the wake of massive and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019.,Tam's trial was the first since Hong Kong's 1997 handover in which a sedition defendant fought his case by pleading not guilty and went through a full trial.,Two previous recent prosecutions were wrapped up after guilty pleas.,As a result, Tam's conviction is a legal watershed because it sets precedents for a host of upcoming sedition prosecutions as China remolds Hong Kong in its own authoritarian image.,Better known by his moniker ""Fast Beat,"" Tak hosted a popular online talk show that backed democracy and was highly critical of the government, often using colorful language.,He was a regular presence at protests and often set up street booths to deliver political speeches.,Prosecutors focused on the street booths, with Tam convicted on seven counts of ""uttering seditious words"" as well as other charges such as disorderly conduct and disobeying a police officer.,Authorities said Tam incited hatred against the authorities by chanting the popular protest slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times"" 171 times, cursing the police force some 120 times, and repeatedly shouting ""Down with the Communist Party.”,""The attack on the Communist Party is only part of the seditious words uttered by the accused,"" district judge Stanley Chan said in his verdict.,""Looking at what he (Tam) said, it's far beyond criticizing and theorizing,"" he added.,Sedition is separate from the sweeping national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in 2020.,But the courts treat it with the same severity and there are plans to make sedition one of a number of new national security crimes later this year, meaning it will soon carry a much longer jail term.,Tam was arrested in September 2020 and denied bail, as happens in most national security cases.,His trial began in July 2021 but was delayed for a landmark High Court ruling in which judges declared the popular protest slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong"" was secessionist and therefore illegal under the new security law.,That ruling legally crystallized the reality that certain views and slogans are now forbidden in Hong Kong under the security law.,In Hong Kong, sedition is broadly defined as any words that generate ""hatred, contempt or disaffection"" towards the government or ""encourage disaffection"" among residents.,It carries up to two years in jail for a first offense.,First penned by colonial ruler Britain in 1938, it was long criticized as an anti-free speech law, including by many of the pro-Beijing local newspapers now praising its use.,By the time of the 1997 handover, it had not been used for decades but remained on the books.,On the same day Tam was convicted, police charged two men aged 17 and 19 with ""uttering seditious words"" in a separate case concerning a campus protest in 2020.,In recent months, sedition charges have been brought against pro-democracy unionists who produced euphemistic children's books about a village of sheep defending itself from wolves; journalists from now-shuttered pro-democracy news outlets; and a former pop star turned democracy activist.,In January, a man was jailed for eight months and a woman 13-and-a-half months after pleading guilty in two separate cases over seditious leaflets.

,"South Africa’s labor ministry says Chinese tech firm Huawei is non-compliant with the country’s employment policies.,Huawei is in talks with the ministry over infringements of the country’s employment policies that require 60% of staff to be local hires. It’s still unclear what a settlement could mean for Huawei and other foreign businesses operating in the country.,The ministry’s employment equity act sets requirements for the number of local hires, including those of disadvantaged backgrounds, at various levels within a corporate structure. And it does regular checks across industries for compliance.,“There is room to employ foreign nationals, especially on companies or employers that come to the country to invest… and also to transfer skills to South Africans. We do allow them to bring 40% of their employees…. We realized that 90% of its workforce, that Huawai is foreign nationals, which is against our employment policies,” says Fikiswa Mncanca-Bede, a lawyer for South Africa’s Department of Employment and Labor.,The labor department launched legal proceedings against Huawei earlier this month.,On Friday, the ministry confirmed it was in settlement negotiations with the tech firm on how to correct the discrepancies.,Huawei did not respond to requests for comment.,Mncanca-Bede says the government’s action should send a signal to all companies that non-compliance will not be tolerated.,“We're not targeting Huawei, but we're also coming for the big companies in South Africa, … because we want to ensure that transformation does not just become a talk, but it must be seen as a reality…. Transformation means even if you employ South Africans, who are the South Africans that were employing? Are they addressing the imbalances of the past?” Mncanca-Bede asked.,The employment equity act aims to correct historic inequalities in the country, including racial preferences from the apartheid era that benefited white workers.,But those regulations are still not playing out as planned in the workforce.,“There's rampant violation of regulations by big companies and small company, and South African companies, not just, you know, these international companies. I would definitely say in relation to all of our labor laws, there’s enforcement problems. I think that the Department of Labor is under resourced,” said Kgomotso Musanabi, a law lecturer at the University of Johannesburg.,In addition to inequities, South Africa is experiencing rampant unemployment, with upwards of 35% of people being jobless.,Musanabi says it’s even worse among the country’s youth.,“I think that government is trying to make an attempt to ensure that all South Africans are employed. But not only that South Africans are employed, but that they acquire sort of globally relevant skills that they need to compete in international markets, particularly tech skills,” Musanabi said.,Companies that are non-compliant face fines.,But labor lawyer Johanette Rheeder says for companies as big as Huawei, those fines are a drop in the bucket and unlikely to have a broader chilling effect.,“In South Africa there’s in many businesses also an attitude of we’ll fix it when we’re caught out. Bigger businesses that's got a better a better social conscience, if I can call it that, do comply…. The middle size and the smaller businesses who just can't afford to comply with all of these legislations, so they basically fix it when they offered when they caught out,” Rheeder said.,Instead, she says bridging education and skills gaps in the country — rather than going after foreign workers — is the best way to address unemployment and inequity.,“The biggest, biggest thing that we can do in my view in this country is to upskill people... there are some strategies that [are] in place, but it's always the struggle between upskilling our local people and not giving jobs to foreigners,” Rheeder said.,The labor department said talks with Huawei are expected to conclude Friday.",https://www.voanews.com/a/huawei-in-talks-with-south-africa-on-labor-lawsuit/6460795.html,"

,"China refused to join its close friend, Russia, in vetoing a U.S.-backed resolution in the U.N. Security Council deploring Russia's attack on Ukraine.,China abstained on the motion but also made statements that could be extremely disappointing to Moscow. Zhang Jun, China’s U.N. ambassador, called for respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine as it was being violated by Russia.,“Ukraine should become a bridge between the East and the West, not an outpost for confrontation between major powers,” Zhang said. However, he also called for understanding Russia’s fears about NATO attempts to expand and include Ukraine as a member.,China has been using this argument about sovereignty and territorial integrity in rejecting foreign comments and opinions about trouble spots such as Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong. It has also used this argument to oppose the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.,""Russian annexation of portions of Ukraine, or invasion and seizure of Kiev, violate China's position that sovereignty is sacrosanct,"" John Culver, a former U.S. intelligence officer said on Twitter.,China’s decision to take a neutral stance on the invasion of Ukraine raises several questions. Did Beijing develop cold feet at the last moment, or did Russia go much further in its military aggression in Ukraine than China had expected?,“The unity and strong resolve of Western countries to isolate Russia is a matter of surprise. China needs to feel the pebbles and carefully walk through the stream,” a senior journalist with state-run Chinese media said while requesting not to be named.,Just a few days ago, Chinese experts had said there was no way Europe would back U.S. proposals against Russia because it was heavily dependent on Russian gas.,Europe’s ability to shun Russia “depends on the extent to which the US is able to replace Russia's natural gas exports,” Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the state-owned ,.,Now that Europe has overcome any hesitation and moved to stop further aggression from Russia, Beijing will be concerned about the more stringent financial sanctions imposed on Moscow, such as the ban on the international operations of the Russian central bank and the cutting Russia out of the SWIFT international fund transfer system.,As the world’s biggest trader, China has strong reasons to worry about being bracketed with Russia, particularly because many Chinese banks have close dealings with Russian financial companies. The stakes are also high for Chinese companies, as 254 of them are listed on U.S. stock exchanges.,For years, China has been trying to take advantage of differences between Washington and Europe. For instance, it has pushed for wider investment opportunities in Europe after the U.S. made it difficult for Chinese companies to buy corporate assets in areas related to security and high technology.,As the biggest importer of crude oil, it is China that will pay a heavy price due to the rise in oil prices, which have touched $100 per barrel. Russia is the second-largest source of oil for China, after Saudi Arabia.,China could face serious difficulties in buying Russian crude after Russia’s ouster from the international payments system, although Russia and China have been working on a payments process that does not require access to SWIFT for bilateral trade.,Within China, almost no one would accept the idea that Chinese authorities, known for taking a long-term view of situations, could have miscalculated or developed cold feet.,But there are signs that Putin did not reveal the full extent of his planned actions to Xi., reported that American intelligence had shared information about Russian preparedness to invade Ukraine with Chinese officials but the latter had rejected the possibility. U.S. officials calculated that China had a lot to lose in a Russian war on Ukraine and hoped Beijing might use its influence on Moscow to stop a direct invasion.",https://www.voanews.com/a/has-china-turned-its-back-on-best-friend-russia-/6461276.html,"

,"​As Russia escalates its invasion of Ukraine, the United States is sending a delegation of former defense officials to Taiwan while keeping communication channels open with Russia’s ally, China.,U.S. officials say China’s decision to back Russia amid its military campaign in Ukraine is causing the Beijing government to become “quite uncomfortable.”,Although Beijing’s spokespeople continue to repeat Russia’s claims accusing NATO of provoking the conflict by expanding its membership over the years, U.S. officials insist the relationship is being strained by both the fighting on the ground and the coordinated response by Europe and the United States.,“It is undeniable that right now, China is occupying an awkward nexus in which they're trying to sustain their deep and fundamental relationship with Russia,” said Kurt Campbell, who is U.S. President Joe Biden’s senior coordinator for Indo-Pacific policy at the White House National Security Council.,“I think they have been concerned by some of the — both the solidarity that everyone has witnessed in the aftermath of the [Russia] invasion — but also by the brutality that is playing out every day with respect to an invasion,” added Campbell on Monday during a webinar hosted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States.,Campbell said the U.S. was hoping China could play a critical role in encouraging Russian President Vladimir Putin to reconsider invading Ukraine but “we believe they [Chinese officials] chose not to weigh in in advance.”,China has refrained from calling Russia’s military actions in Ukraine “an invasion,” saying China “understands Russia’s legitimate concerns on security issues.”,Monday in Beijing, a spokesperson from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Wang Wenbin repeated China’s partnership with Russia.,“China and Russia are comprehensive strategic partners of coordination. Our relationship features non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of any third party,” said Wang during a briefing.,In Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy is on high alert after Chinese military planes flew into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) during consecutive days amid Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.,“7 PLA aircraft (Y-8 ASW, J-16*4 and J-10*2) entered #Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ on Feb. 28, 2022,” said Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense in a tweet., ,on Monday follow Beijing’s daily dispatch of warplanes into Taiwan’s ADIZ from February 23-27, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense.,In a move seen as showing support to Taiwan, Biden is sending a delegation of former senior defense and security officials to Taiwan.,Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michèle A. Flournoy, former White House deputy national security adviser Meghan O'Sullivan and others are visiting Taiwan March 1-2.,The U.S. delegation “sends an important signal about the bipartisan U.S. commitment to Taiwan and its democracy and demonstrates that the Biden Administration’s and the United States’ commitment to Taiwan remains rock solid,” said a senior administration official.,In a separate briefing, Campbell also said the U.S. is not diverting its goal to enhance ties with the Indo-Pacific region.,“You will see over the course of the next several months a determination to sustain high-level engagement in the Indo-Pacific with presidential travel. We will be announcing that ASEAN leaders, for the first time, will be coming to Washington in March shortly.”,Saturday, a U.S. naval vessel sailed through the Taiwan Strait, a move seen as a warning to China not to make any rash moves on Taiwan.,“The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Ralph Johnson (DDG 114) is conducting a routine Taiwan Strait transit Feb. 26 through international waters in accordance with international law. The ship is transiting through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal State,” said the U.S. 7th fleet in a statement on Twitter., ,Analysts are watching China’s next move after it abstained from a U.N. Security Council vote to denounce Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,“China was close to joining Russia in a veto, but changed position when [the] U.S. watered down [the] resolution text. I think this is a sign of both Chinese influence and its desire to avoid taking hits over Ukraine at the U.N. So it sends a complex bunch of messages (none too awful for Russia),” said International Crisis Group U.N. Director Richard Gowan in a tweet.,Gowan added while China’s abstention is a relief for the U.S., he would not “mistake [it] as a real blow to Russia. Moscow knows China is keeping its head down, and won’t take any serious action against it.”, ,Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi confirmed during his Saturday call with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock that “when the Security Council discussed the resolution related to the Ukraine issue, China prevented quoting expressions that contain the authorization of the use of force and sanctions.” Wang was referring to U.N.

,"Amid growing pressure from rights groups, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, will update the 49th session of the Human Rights Council on March 7 on her efforts to assess the situation in Xinjiang, a spokesperson from her office told VOA.,In recent weeks, rights activists and U.S. politicians have been pressuring Bachelet to release a report on human rights in Xinjiang, a region in northwest China that is home to Uyghurs who are Muslim and a minority group.,Mainly Western countries, including the United States, and rights organizations accuse China of human rights violations, including forced sterilization of Uyghur women, torture, forced labor and the detention of more than 1 million Uyghurs and other Turkic groups in internment camps in Xinjiang. The U.S. government has described the violations as genocide and crimes against humanity.,The push for the release of the report comes after years of unsuccessful efforts by Bachelet’s office to negotiate the terms of a visit to Xinjiang to assess the human rights situation there.,In a video speech to the 49th United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva on Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, “The door of Xinjiang is open, and we welcome people from all countries to visit Xinjiang and have exchanges.”,He went on to refute allegations of abuse and said, “The so-called genocide, forced labor and religious repression, are lies that are completely fabricated."" ,
China says the facilities in Xinjiang are only vocational training centers – and that Beijing’s Xinjiang policies are aimed at fighting extremism, terrorism and separatism.,While discussions between Bachelet’s office and Beijing are ongoing, “the parameters for a visit will have to be such that the High Commissioner has unfettered, meaningful access, including unsupervised interviews with civil society,” the high commissioner’s spokesperson, Liz Throssell, told VOA in an email.,Uyghurs’ rights groups are doubtful there will be changes to the status quo. ,
“We don't expect the visit will take place soon, given that the high commissioner has failed to reach an agreement with the government of China for the past three years,” said Zumretay Arkin, program and advocacy manager at the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress.,A Uyghur government official in Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, told VOA that for any Uyghur “to be able to speak [freely] and tell what is happening, they [would] have to be out” of China.,“There’s a tragedy in every [Uyghur] family, at least someone has disappeared without a trace. But I can’t tell you in detail,” the Uyghur official who requested anonymity for his safety said. “No one is calm. Every family is weeping over someone.”,Abdulhakim Idris, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Uyghur Studies, accuses Bachelet of being mostly passive on Uyghur human rights since she assumed her position in September 2018.,“These are not only my words; even her official told us that she had been disregarding the reports and documents detailing Uyghur human rights” in China, Idris told VOA.,Idris said that in late 2018, he and other Uyghur rights activists met a Bachelet office staffer in Geneva who was working on the China human rights issue. ,
“We were told that when reports and documents got into her office, the reports they had submitted would be ignored,” Idris said.,“Every year Uyghurs hoped that on behalf of the U.N., Bachelet would say something about the Uyghurs’ dire human rights situation,” Idris said. “All these years, Bachelet had been careful not to anger China, that’s why she has been delaying this urgent report.”,In an email, Bachelet’s office told VOA the accusations are false and that since allegations of “human rights violations in Xinjiang emerged, the U.N. Human Rights Office has been consistently gathering, documenting and analyzing the information that has come to our attention.” Bachelet’s office also said she has been working on visiting Xinjiang “based on meaningful access” while continuing to monitor the situation and assess the situation there remotely.,Last September, Bachelet expressed regret at not making any progress on her “efforts to seek meaningful access to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region” to probe human rights.,""In the meantime, my office is finalizing its assessment of the available information on allegations of serious human rights violations in that region, with a view to making it public,” Bachelet said at the opening of the Human Rights Council in September in Geneva.,In December, after an unofficial tribunal in London said that China has “committed genocide and crimes against humanity and torture against Uyghurs, Kazakh and other ethnic minority citizens” in Xinjiang, a spokesperson for the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Rupert Colville, said that Bachelet had hoped to publish the report on Xinjiang in the coming weeks.,Adrian Zenz is director and senior fellow of China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington. Zenz said the only way to make genuine progress on documenting China’s actions would be to take Uyghurs out of Xinjiang for completely unsupervised conversations with U.N. officials.,However, if it is a visit as suggested by Wang, Beijing will “closely control what people see on the ground, and that’s all the more because actually a fairly substantial number of internment camps have been securitized or closed down,” Zenz told VOA. “People have been shifted into forced labor or sentenced to long-term prisons.” ",https://www.voanews.com/a/update-on-xinjiang-assessment-expected-amid-pressure-from-rights-groups/6464781.html,"

,"A Chinese official's pitch this week for stronger Sino-U.S. relations could indicate that Beijing wants to edge away from Russia and repair economic relations, some analysts say. ,
,
In a speech Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Washington to ""reinstate a reasonable and pragmatic China policy"" and ""promote putting bilateral ties back on the right track,"" the state-run China Daily news website reported. ,
,
A breakthrough in Sino-U.S. relations would mark a turning point since the two powers began sparring in 2017 over trade, technology transfers and growing Chinese military might around Asia. U.S. President Joe Biden's government , it still sees China as a competitor that's ""unfair"" in trade. , , ,China has tried to avoid siding openly with Russia on its invasion of Ukraine last week despite a long, deepening friendship with Moscow., ,
China did not join Russia in vetoing a U.S.-backed U.N. Security Council resolution against the attack, and its U.N. ambassador suggested that Ukraine form a ""bridge"" between the East and West . , Washington has blasted its former Cold War rival Russia over the invasion.,Wang is ""trying to make nice"" in view of China's ""increasingly"" close ties with Russia, said Sean King, vice president of Park Strategies political consultancy in New York. ""These are perilous times when we see who's who and what's what,"" King said. ,Chinese officials are hoping the U.S. side will welcome their appeal for better relations as the United States faces ""mounting inflation"" among other economic issues, said Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. ,Wang said Monday that China was willing to work with the United States on a G-7-led global infrastructure plan called Build Back Better World and welcomes Washington in its Belt and Road Initiative aimed at opening trade routes by building new infrastructure. Biden happens to be pushing the U.S. Senate for a $2-trillion social spending bill, which also is called Build Back Better. ,""Now that the U.S. is embroiled in the confrontation with Russia, the U.S. will need friends and allies, and China has been adopting a rather ambivalent attitude with regards to the Ukraine invasion, so that creates a window of opportunity for the U.S. and China to come closer together,"" Oh said. ,China could offer the United States ""cost effective technology"" for railways and prefabricated bridges, said Eduardo Araral, associate professor at the National University of Singapore's public policy school. But he said Washington may be ""too proud"" to accept that support. ,He said that bickering between the two powers has eased already. ""Now it's either no news or positive news, which is good news,"" Araral said. ""At least there's no more shouting match or megaphone diplomacy."" , ,Wang spoke Monday at a video ceremony marking the 50-year anniversary of the Shanghai Communique. Former Chinese leader Mao Zedong and former U.S. President Richard Nixon signed the statement as a prelude to normalizing two-way relations. ,""History tells us that by seeking common ground while reserving differences, we can attain peaceful co-existence between countries with different social systems,"" the foreign minister said. ,""The older generation of leaders in both countries realized that despite the differences, neither side had the intention to change the other,"" he said. ""Both sides hoped to see that the two countries could grow in parallel and conduct cooperation based on shared interests."" , ,The Chinese foreign minister's comments, however, offer no actual deal. Wang criticized Washington on Monday as not ""earnestly complying with the principles and spirit"" of the Shanghai Communique, China Daily reported. ,""It should abandon its mania for zero-sum games, give up its obsession with encircling and containing China, and break free from the shackles of political correctness,"" he told the video ceremony. ,Americans continue to worry about China. Some point to China's growing use of , and its links to COVID-19. The coronavirus was first reported in China in late 2019. ,""Unfortunately, with the virus, everybody blames China, so I don't think it's going to change,"" said Sylvia Rampi, general manager for an association of mostly Chinese-operated businesses in Oakland, California. , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/why-china-s-foreign-minister-suddenly-wants-stronger-sino-us-relations-/6465412.html,"

,"With a library here, a power station there, China is using aid and investment to increase its presence in Central America, posing a challenge to the United States’ 2-century-old diplomatic dominance in the region.,China’s interest is driven in part by its rivalry for diplomatic recognition with Taiwan, a self-governing island which has claimed to be the legitimate government of China since the communist victory on the mainland in 1949. But Beijing is also open about its ambition to supplant the United States as the world’s dominant power.,Swayed by Beijing’s dollar diplomacy, three Central American countries — Panama, El Salvador and Nicaragua — have switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China since 2017. So too has the nearby Caribbean island nation of Dominican Republic.,Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and Belize round out the nations of the isthmus connecting North and South America, a region first claimed as part of the U.S. sphere of influence with the enunciation of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823.,Luis G. Solis, interim director of the Kimberly Green Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University, told VOA Mandarin that the U.S. still enjoys an advantage in the region in terms of military, economic, trade, and cultural affairs.,“If these advantages are adequately handled through a proactive diplomacy and a solid developmental agenda, China’s space will be greatly diminished,” he said. “But this entails creativity, the investment of time and goodwill, and a permanent and productive dialogue on sensitive issues such as migrations, corruption and transnational organized crime.”,China’s most recent investment occurred in El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele thanked China for funding of the country’s new national library as construction began Feb. 6.,The $40 million cultural center, located in the capital city of San Salvador, resulted from Bukele’s visit to China in 2019, according to Evan Ellis, a senior associate at the Americas Program of CSIS. The president also secured $500 million for projects including a sports stadium, a new tourist pier, improvement of its water treatment facilities as well as backing for his Surf City project to turn the country’s Pacific coast into a beach vacation destination, according to the 2021 CSIS article, ,.,Also in 2019, El Salvador signed on with China’s controversial Belt and Road Initiative, (BRI) a global infrastructure plan consisting of a “belt” of overland corridors and a maritime “road” of shipping lanes.,Bukele’s efforts came after El Salvador severed its ties with Taiwan in 2018 under his predecessor, Salvador Sánchez Cerén, who led the fight against a U.S.-backed regime during a civil war that lasted from 1979-92.,China’s buildup in Central America has grown since management of the Panama Canal transferred from the joint U.S.-Panamanian Panama Canal Commission to the Republic of Panama in 1999, according to an article by Daniel Runde, director of the Americas Program at CSIS.,In November 1999, the Panamanian government awarded the Hong-Kong based firm Hutchison-Whampoa concessions to operate ports on both the Atlantic and Pacific sides of the canal, according to the website DialogoChino.,Since then, “Chinese companies have been heavily involved in infrastructure-related contracts in and around the canal, in Panama’s logistics, electricity, and construction sectors,” according to DialogoChino.,By 2017, Panama had shifted diplomatic relations from Taiwan to Beijing and five months later became the first country in the region to join BRI. Since then, China has invested in over 20 infrastructure projects in the country, including bridges, railways and power stations. As of January, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras are not BRI partners with China.,China's state-back media , published an opinion piece on December 13, 2021, by Pan Deng, executive director of the Latin American and Caribbean Region Law Center of China University of Political Science and Law. He suggested that the U.S. views Central American nations as ""sources of cheap labor and low-end industrial raw materials, but also the dumping ground for outmoded American industries.”,The piece continued to say, ""Previously, these countries had no other choices but to turn to the U.S. However, as China has developed rapidly in recent years, a reference model is being provided for how developing countries can develop from backward agricultural countries to industrialized ones while achieving long-term social stability."",Analysts say that Beijing is using aid in various guises to persuade more Central American and Caribbean countries to establish formal relationships with the People’s Republic of China (PRC).,Benjamin Gedan, deputy director of the Wilson Center's Latin American Program, told VOA Mandarin that Beijing has an economic agenda in Central America and the Caribbean, but the effort is driven largely by geopolitical considerations, “including its bitter rivalry with Taiwan and its desire for support in multilateral institutions.”,“Given the Chinese Communist Party’s intense focus on isolating Taiwan, it is likely to continue investing in Central America and the Caribbean. After all, Beijing likely sees these countries as relatively cheap to buy off, and it has enjoyed a string of diplomatic victories,” Gedan added.,Another goal for China’s efforts in the region is to expand the BRI to Central America, as a push to play a bigger role on the global stage.,In December 2021, Cuba became the latest country to join China's Belt and Road initiative. Jamaica joined in 2019, as did six other island nations in the Caribbean, and Costa Rica joined in 2018.,China has also increased its investment in natural resources in Central America and the Caribbean Basin. According to the Congressional Research Service, in 2020, China’s imports from Latin America and Caribbean countries amounted to $165 billion, consisting primarily of natural resources, such as ores (35%), mineral fuels (12%) and copper (6%).,Rebecca Ray, a senior academic researcher at the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, told VOA Mandarin that she’s not surprised to see China’s interest in infrastructure cooperation with Central America and productive investments in the Caribbean.,She pointed out that the Central American region has suffered from weak economic growth for decades. It is also vulnerable to climate change, which is bringing more natural disasters to low-lying islands and coastal areas. As a result, according to Ray, these countries have a greater need for new inbound investment.,“At the same time, Western investors have not shown interest in starting new projects or being exposed to developing country economies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, any new potential source of investment will naturally be taken seriously,” she added.,Despite the need for infrastructure investment in Central America and the Caribbean, the biggest obstacle to maintaining economic growth may be poor governance, according to online magazine ,.,“Partnership with China might bring in new foreign investments, but it only deepens governance challenges, given China’s disinterest in corruption, its lack of transparency, and its export of technologies that enable Central American governments to curtail civil liberties,” said Gedan.,Microsoft said in December 2021 that it believed Beijing-backed hackers were targeting organizations in both the private and public sectors in five Central American nations: Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama.",https://www.voanews.com/a/china-expands-influence-in-central-america/6456733.html,"

,"China has condemned Australia’s plans to boost its scientific and strategic presence in Antarctica. The government in Canberra on Tuesday announced plans to fly a fleet of surveillance drones and long-range helicopters over the icy continent.,Australia’s $570 million Antarctic plan has environmental and strategic ambitions. It aims to chart unexplored parts of the continent’s interior with drones and long-range helicopters to boost research into glaciers, marine science and rising sea levels.,Australia also has concerns about China’s expansion in the increasingly contested region.,At a media conference Tuesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not mention specific countries by name, but he said some were eager to “exploit its resources."",“We are stewards of some of the most important and most sensitive environments anywhere in the world,” he said. “We need to keep eyes on Antarctica because there are others who have different objectives to us.”,Australia lays claim to more than 42% of the continent, a territorial ambition that is recognized by few other nations.,The Australian government wants to uphold the 1961 Antarctic Treaty, which bans military and mining activity. About 30 countries maintain dozens of research bases on the world’s coldest, driest, and windiest continent.,Professor Donald Rothwell is from the Australian National University’s College of Law. He said some countries have ambitions to use the continent for defense purposes.,“Antarctica was demilitarized under the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and also de-nuclearized,” he said. “Antarctic is a nuclear-free zone but that does not mean to say that issues have not been raised from time to time about dual-use capacity, and also, dual-use technology.”,China’s state media outlet , said Beijing had “always abided by the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty System in carrying out scientific expeditions in the Antarctic region.”,It claimed Australia’s multimillion-dollar plan was part of the “Morrison government’s anti-China agenda” and was driven by “their hostility toward China.”,Relations between Australia and China — its biggest trading partner — have soured in recent years. There have been various diplomatic flashpoints, including allegations of Chinese interference in Australia’s domestic affairs.,The China state-owned , said Canberra was “driving the bilateral relations toward a dead end.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-s-antarctic-plans-anger-china/6456900.html,"

,"As Taiwan continues to face a military threat from China, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said this week the Taiwanese government continues to focus on its “asymmetric defense” capability — including U.S. assistance — to make it an unattractive target, despite its limited military power.,Taiwan’s current strategy is to make certain “China will understand it will pay a very heavy price if it initiates conflict against Taiwan,” Wu said during a virtual event hosted by the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University.,Speaking with former U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Wu argued for continued U.S. support of Taiwan through arms sales, military exchanges, shared intelligence, and freedom of navigation exercises in the Taiwan Strait.,“We want the people here in Taiwan to be able to defend themselves if China is going to launch a war against Taiwan,” Wu said.,Taiwan has lived under the threat of military action by China since China’s Nationalist Party, the Kuomintang fled the mainland after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949. While the conflict has remained largely a stalemate since then — with Beijing continuing to claim Taiwan as a province — an aggressive military modernization campaign by China means it could be able to attack Taiwan as early as 2027, according to the U.S. Defense Department.,Wu said China could have the potential to attack targets other than Taiwan in the future.,""China has made so much investment and have modernized their military capable of not only striking at Taiwan but go beyond the first island chain, so we need to develop our asymmetric warfare so that Taiwan is able to defend itself,” he said, referring to the name of the defensive barrier of Taiwan, Japan, Okinawa, and the northern Philippines.,Similar concerns have led the United States as well as France, Japan, Australia, India, South Korea, the Philippines, and the European Union to become more vocal about the future of Indo-Pacific security in the face of a rising China. Earlier this month, Washington released its latest Indo-Pacific strategy, which called for greater cooperation with regional partners.,Wu said Taiwan must be “very careful” to not provoke China and trigger a conflict. The most recent incident occurred in 1995 and 1996, when China fired missiles toward Taiwan ahead of its first democratic elections. Future triggers could include a formal declaration of independence by Taiwan from China, which is why leaders such as President Tsai Ing-wen are extremely careful when they discuss Taiwan’s political status.,Wu said domestic problems could also force Beijing’s hand if it needed to unite China against a common enemy. “We also need to watch out for this classical theory about authoritarian countries. They like to divert domestic attention by initiating external conflict. If something is happening in China, inside their country, for example, economic slowdown, unemployment, or major disasters, things like that, that might be the time that we need to watch very carefully,” he said.,In the meantime, Taiwan continues to face Chinese efforts to sway public opinion and destroy morale from within Taiwan by convincing civilians “democracy is doomed.” Tactics have included more than 1,000 Chinese People’s Liberation Army air sorties toward Taiwan last year, Wu said, as well as disinformation campaigns and political infiltration.,Wu said these tactics are “below the thresholds of a military conflict” but still require Taiwan and allies such as the United States to keep pushing back.,Events like Wu’s talk at the McCain Institute are part of Taiwan’s greater public relations strategy to remain a central concern for both the U.S. government and the U.S. public, said Kitsch Liao Yen-fan, a cyber and military affairs consultant at the Taiwanese civil society group Doublethink Lab. ,Liao said this was a particular concern for Taiwan after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan last year, as the U.S. public may not want to see its military send troops to another foreign conflict. While the United States is not formally committed to defending Taiwan if it were attacked, under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act it has pledged to help it defend itself.,Whether this would ever extend to sending U.S. personnel to Taiwan in a wartime scenario, however, is still a topic of debate — and a decision that Taipei hopes to influence.,Talks like those by Wu, however, “create sufficient momentum to tip public opinion on Taiwan’s side, and on the political side of the United States to reach a tipping point where the willingness to actually send the military into the next conflict will be reversed again,” said Liao.",https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-foreign-minister-calls-us-help-critical-to-deterring-war-with-china-/6456995.html,"

,"The British government has decided to expand a program allowing some Hong Kong residents to settle in the U.K., providing a potential lifeboat for thousands of young people seeking to escape increasingly repressive Chinese rule in the former British colony.,The British Nationals Overseas, or BNO, plan that gives millions of Hong Kong residents the chance of British citizenship, was launched 13 months ago. The move came after the Chinese government imposed a national security law on Hong Kong, which critics say has restricted the city's freedoms.,Previously, only Hong Kong residents born before 1997 — when the city was handed back to China from Britain — were eligible to apply for citizenship through the plan.,But following a parliamentary meeting Thursday, British Immigration Minister Kevin Foster outlined in a written statement the changes, which are expected to go into effect in October.,""It is right and important to address this, so the Government has made the decision to enable individuals aged 18 or over who were born on or after 1 July 1997 and who have at least one BN(O) parent to apply to the route independently of their BN(O) parent,"" ,.,Approximately 5.4 million residents were eligible for the BNO plan prior to Thursday's amendment, with more than 100,000 applications received since January last year. Successful applicants can work and study in Britain for up to five years, after which they can apply for citizenship.,But a campaign backed by senior British politicians and the last governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, urged British lawmakers to open the plan to Hong Kong's younger residents.,Britain-based Hong Kong Watch, a nonprofit organization monitoring human rights and freedoms, , welcoming the news.,""We are delighted that the Government has taken the bold and moral step to expand the BNO Visa for those brave young Hong Kongers who are not currently covered by the scheme.”,Benedict Rogers, Hong Kong Watch chief executive, praised the move.,""This is a very significant development, which will provide a lifeline to many young Hong Kongers whose only option until now was applying for asylum. It sends a clear message that the U.K. will honor its responsibilities to Hong Kongers and that Hong Kongers are very welcome in the U.K.,"" he told VOA.,The Hong Kong government Friday condemned the move, telling VOA in an email it “deplores and opposes British Government's interference on Hong Kong affairs by providing holders of the British National (Overseas) (BN(O) passport or eligible for it a pathway to reside and obtain citizenship in the UK.”,China and the U.K. “previously exchanged memoranda in which the UK clearly pledged not to confer the right of abode in the UK on holders of the BN(O) passport who are Chinese nationals in Hong Kong,” the email from the Security Bureau’s Press Office said.,“The measures taken by the British Government on the pretext of the National Security Law are purely made out of political maneuver. They not only seriously violate the UK's own pledge made in the British memorandum exchanged with the Chinese Government, but also seriously interfere in the affairs of the HKSAR,” it said, referring to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.,“The HKSAR Government urges the British Government to stop interfering in the affairs of the HKSAR and return to the normal tracks,"" it said. ,In 2019, Hong Kong saw widespread anti-government protests that sometimes turned violent as demonstrators opposed a controversial extradition bill and called for further freedoms. Many demonstrators were either students or in their 20s.,Beijing responded by passing the national security law for Hong Kong in June 2020. It strictly prohibits acts deemed as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.,British Prime Minister Boris Johnson then announced that his government was launching the BNO program to aid residents in the former British colony because the security legislation threatened Hong Kong's unique freedoms.,China has not recognized the BNO passport for Hong Kong residents since Jan. 31, 2021.,The lifeboat plan, however, has already contributed to thousands leaving, data suggest. According to data released by Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong's population declined 1.2% by mid-2021, equating to approximately 89,200 people, the biggest decrease in Hong Kong's population in 60 years, Agence France-Presse reported.,A government spokesperson has defended the decline, insisting the figures are due to a lack of new arrivals into the city.,Joseph Cheng, a political analyst formerly of Hong Kong but now in New Zealand, said the amendment is a boost for younger Hong Kong residents.,""This is going to be a major help to the young people in Hong Kong who want to emigrate, especially for those who do not have the wealth. The U.K. has been the most favored destination for Hong Kong people who plan to leave,"" he told VOA.,""The exodus reflects the general disappointment with the government on the part of the Hong Kong society,"" Cheng added.,An initial assessment by the British government previously estimated that by 2026, up to 300,000 could apply to emigrate via the BNO plan. As of Dec. 31, 2021, 103,900 applications had been received.,Ernie, a 20-year-old student in Hong Kong, told VOA he would now consider applying for the plan.,""I feel positive that the U.K. government is finally stepping up, helping the young adults in Hong Kong. [The] Hong Konger community in the U.K. is huge and growing. It would be easier for Hong Kong people to settle,"" he said.,Ernie is considering moving to Britain because of health and political measures in Hong Kong.,""[Hong Kong is] too strict in pandemic measures. [And the] political environment keeps evolving. The idea that a lot of people who you support three, four years ago, before any protest begin, are being prosecuted and jailed right now for whatever reason seems frightening,"" he said.,Michael Mo, a former district councilor in Hong Kong who now resides in Britain, said many who emigrate will be students needing financial support for their studies.,""The next step of the U.K. government, if they change the rules, should allow BNO visa holders to be treated as home fee students at universities. ""Home fees are capped by the Government and generally lower than international fees,"" according to the ,.,Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that would see the city enjoy a ""high degree of autonomy"" for 50 years. But critics have said Beijing has since broken this agreement by tightening its grip on the city's political and lawful affairs.,Hong Kong's national security law has had a dramatic effect on the city. Street protests and slogans have been banned.

,"Pakistan said Friday foreign ministers of six immediate neighbors of Afghanistan will gather in China next month to discuss economic and humanitarian upheavals facing the Taliban-ruled, conflict-torn country.,
,
Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told a news conference in Islamabad that his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, will also attend the Beijing-hosted two-day meeting starting March 30.,Qureshi said the discussions would focus on ways to protect the Afghan people from the humanitarian crisis and prevent an economic meltdown in Afghanistan.,
,
""If there is, God forbid, an economic meltdown (in Afghanistan), its repercussions will hit not only Pakistan but other neighboring countries and the region at large,"" Qureshi cautioned.,
,
The gathering in China will be the third such dialogue among Afghanistan's neighbors, including China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, since the Taliban takeover of the country in August.,
,
Islamabad initiated and hosted the inaugural session of the process in September after the Taliban militarily seized power from the now-defunct Western-backed Afghan government and U.S.-led international forces withdrew from the country.,
,
Tehran hosted the second foreign ministers' meeting in late October.,
,
,
,
A senior Pakistani Foreign Ministry official told VOA that Taliban leaders will be invited to the two-day discussions in China to allow them to directly share their assessment of the latest Afghan situation.,
,
The official, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to media, said a trilateral dialogue involving Afghanistan, Pakistan and China will also be held on the sidelines of the meeting.,
,
He said Chinese and Pakistani officials are expected to discuss and propose economic connectivity projects to Taliban delegates under an ongoing mega-infrastructure development program China is funding in Pakistan. The official did not share further details.,The program, known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), is hailed as a flagship of Beijing's global Belt and Road Initiative. It has built roads, power plants and other infrastructure projects in Pakistan with Chinese investments over the past seven years.,
,
""The two sides are ready to discuss with Afghanistan the extension of CPEC to Afghanistan,"" read a joint statement issued at the end of wide-ranging bilateral talks President Xi Jinping hosted with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan in Beijing earlier this month.,
,
,
,
When the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan six months ago, wide-ranging international sanctions dating back to the Islamist group's first time in power from 1996 to 2001 followed.,
,
Washington and other Western nations also suspended financial aid to Kabul and immediately froze billions of dollars in the Afghan central bank's assets, mostly held in the U.S.,
,
The restrictions have pushed the country's heavily aid-dependent economy to the brink of collapse, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, where the United Nations estimates around 23 million people, or 55 percent of the population, face acute hunger.,Foreign countries, including immediate neighbors, have not recognized the Taliban as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan.,
,
The global community wants the hardline group to govern Afghanistan through a broad-based ruling system that represents all Afghan ethnicities, respects human rights, including women's rights to education and work, and disallows terrorists from using the country for cross-border attacks.,
,
Taliban leaders dismiss criticism of their government, saying it is representative of all Afghans, and women are being given access to education as well as work in accordance with Islamic Sharia law. They also claim no terrorist groups are being allowed to use the country for international attacks, assertions disputed by foreign officials and independent critics.,
,
The Taliban under the previous government had banned females from education and work and harbored the al-Qaida terrorist network blamed for orchestrating the September 2001 attacks on the United States.",https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-host-afghanistan-s-neighbors-to-review-post-taliban-situation-/6459511.html,"

,"A former White House national security adviser said the Biden administration should call on China to act to show that it is serious about denuclearizing North Korea and that Washington’s options for dealing with North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs are running out fast.,“For too many years, we have let China get away with responsibility for North Korea,” said John Bolton, the national security adviser to former President Donald Trump from April 2018 to September 2019. “As part of the realignment of American policy toward Beijing … China’s responsibility for North Korea has to be put at the center.”,Bolton said during an interview with VOA’s Korean Service on Friday that the Biden administration’s options for dealing with North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs are “small and decreasing rapidly” as the regime’s “immediate threat” of intermediate-range ballistic missiles is “present right now.”,North Korea tested 11 missiles in January, concluding the month with an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. territory of Guam.,Denuclearization talks between Washington and Pyongyang have been stalled since October 2019.,Washington has been , to meet with Pyongyang without preconditions, but North Korea has largely dismissed the calls for talks.,Ken Gause, director of the Adversary Analytics Program at the research and analysis organization CNA, said one option Washington has right now is to “try to freeze” North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs.,“Denuclearization is a bridge too far right now,” Gause said. “A wiser thing to do is to try to put things on the table in return for a freeze — no provocations, no proliferation, and no tests.”,Bolton said the threat of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons proliferation “is increasing day by day” and suggested the Biden administration needs to ensure China takes action to back up statements that it does not want a nuclear North Korea.,“China has masqueraded for 30 years as just another disinterested party that says it doesn’t want North Korea to have nuclear weapons. Well, if it were serious, it could make that happen,” Bolton said.,“I think it’s important to the world that we put China to the proof on this – either you do what you alone have the capability of doing, which is changing the regime behavior in North Korea, or we draw the conclusion, the legitimate conclusion, that you’re fine with North Korea having a nuclear weapon,” he added.,China, North Korea’s top trading partner, has often been accused of , placed on North Korea in 2016 to curb its nuclear and missile programs.,China and Russia, permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, ,. Most recently, on Jan. 20, Beijing and Moscow , on North Korea after the regime’s fourth missile test of the month.,Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA’s Korean Service on Friday evening that ""China’s position on the Korean Peninsula issue is consistent and clear. We hope relevant sides will resolve respective concerns through dialogue and consultation.”,He continued, saying “China has always been seriously implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions concerning DPRK. As long as the resolutions are still effective, we will earnestly fulfill our international responsibilities and deal with relevant matters according to the resolutions.”,Bolton said North Korea is unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons and missile programs through negotiations, adding that the U.S. should not rule out considering the possibility of a regime change or the use of force as an option.,“The U.S. should not be held hostage by a regime like this,” Bolton said. “That’s why possibilities for regime change or if necessary, use of force against the North Korean nuclear program cannot be ruled out.”,VOA’s Korean Service contacted North Korea's U.N. Mission for comment on Bolton’s remarks but did not receive a reply.,Other experts believe the U.S. should pursue a diplomatic solution.,Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said Washington should seek a deal with Pyongyang through negotiations, although he admits “denuclearization is not possible for the foreseeable future.”,“I expect the U.S. will seek to limit North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs in exchange for political and economic steps, such as sanctions relief,” he said.,The Biden administration says it remains committed to diplomacy with North Korea.,""The United States holds no hostile intent towards the DPRK and we are open to meeting the DPRK without preconditions,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA’s Korean Service on Thursday. DPRK represents North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.,Liu, the Chinese Embassy spokesperson, said “If the U.S. truly cares about the well-being of the DPRK people, it should not keep pressuring the DPRK with sanctions. Instead, it should face up to the denuclearization measures already taken by the DPRK, respond to its legitimate and reasonable concerns and take measures to ease sanctions on the DPRK."",Bolton , floated by some North Korea watchers that the Biden administration should try Trump-style personal diplomacy or high-level engagement to reengage North Korean leader Kim Jong Un into denuclearization talks.,Bolton was present at the two summits that Trump held with Kim, first in Singapore in June 2018 and then in Hanoi in February 2019.,“They gave cover for North Korea systemically to make additional progress on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs under the appearance that they were trying to work out an arrangement with President Trump,” he said.",https://www.voanews.com/a/bolton-us-should-confront-china-on-north-korea/6450190.html,"

,"A major initiative to strengthen and cement America’s ties with Asia and counterbalance China's expanding influence lacks robust trade incentives that are viewed as politically perilous in the United States, where protectionist sentiment runs high, experts told VOA.,The United States needs to intensify its focus on the Indo-Pacific region because of the “mounting challenges” posed by the rise of China, according to a , released by the Biden administration last week.,“The PRC [People's Republic of China] is combining its economic, diplomatic, military and technological might as it pursues a sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and seeks to become the world’s most influential power,” the strategy document said.,That description of China largely mirrors the view taken by the former Trump administration, which often took a bluntly adversarial stance toward Beijing. Beyond rhetoric, however, Biden’s strategy seeks to shore up regional alliances and partnerships that many see as critical to U.S. strategy in Asia.,It responds to the desire of many countries in the region for the United States to play a galvanizing role in addressing common challenges such as public health, climate change and anti-corruption, Ryan Hass, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA.,“It is a welcome departure from the America-first mindset during the Trump era,” Hass said.,The new strategy calls for advancing freedom and openness, building collective defense capacity within and beyond the region, and building regional resilience. It also embraces what the administration calls “promoting shared prosperity.”,But Hass and other observers say the Indo-Pacific strategy lacks a coherent trade framework that gives countries in the region a good economic reason to deepen relations with the U.S. They say Washington’s international economic agenda should match the leadership role the United States seeks for itself in the region.,Robert Daly, director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, told VOA the strategy suffers from a fundamental contradiction in that it implies that the U.S. will engage in a high degree of global activism, following years of far more isolationist foreign policy under the Trump administration. At the same time, the Biden administration has not primed the American public to shift away from the Trumpian critique of globalization.,“They've put themselves in a box where they, for political reasons, seem to accept the Trump view that globalization is the playground of self-indulgent coastal American elites who don't care about the heartland [of America],” Daly said. “What was needed was a better form of globalization that serves American interests — the Biden administration has chosen not to take that on.,Preceding Trump, the former Obama administration championed the ,, a massive trade agreement with 11 other countries designed to be the cornerstone of U.S. economic policy in the region. The Trump administration withdrew from the TPP in 2017, leaving the other members to sign a revised deal, called Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).,With no public support for multilateral trade agreements, the Biden administration has said it has no plans to join the CPTPP and has made clear it intends to continue its predecessor’s protectionist trade policies.,The White House has not yet shared details of its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, a component of the larger Indo-Pacific Strategy. The framework, which they billed as a “multilateral partnership for the 21st century,” was scheduled for launch early this year.,“As we consult with the Indo-Pacific partners, Congress and other stakeholders, we will have more to share as the process is ongoing,"" deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told VOA on Thursday. “It's underway.”,The administration said the framework would “promote and facilitate high-standards trade, govern the digital economy, improve supply-chain resiliency and security, catalyze investment in transparent, high-standards infrastructure, and build digital connectivity — doubling down on our economic ties to the region while contributing to broadly shared Indo-Pacific opportunity.”,But officials have acknowledged the framework will not include opening up American markets, the economic carrot that analysts say is missing from the strategy.,“Why would regional states agree to serious concessions on climate or labor standards if the United States is unwilling to discuss trade or investment liberalization?” asked Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “It appears that Washington is content to remain on the sidelines as Beijing integrates more deeply into the region’s economic order.”,In a briefing to reporters this month, a senior administration official acknowledged that regional countries want more but are “very realistic” about the constraints and challenges that shape the Biden trade policy.,Some analysts see the potential for incentives beyond market access.,“The promise of this [Indo-Pacific] initiative is that it will offer some other things that aren't market access,” said Matthew Goodman, senior vice president for economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Goodman told VOA those may include improving international trade regulations or investing in infrastructure as promised in the Build Back Better World initiative.,Biden launched his , plan (B3W) during the June 2021 Group of Seven summit, with the goal of creating “a values-driven, high-standard and transparent infrastructure partnership” to help finance projects in developing countries.,U.S. officials led by Daleep Singh, the deputy national security adviser for international economics, have scouted several countries in Latin America and Africa to identify potential infrastructure projects, particularly those that focus on climate, health, digital technology and gender equality.,""There's been enormous enthusiasm in every country we visited, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Ghana, Senegal, DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo], parts of the Middle East, Indonesia, Thailand, and other parts of the world,"" Singh told VOA Friday.,B3W has been framed as an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing’s international development program that has financed infrastructure projects in Asia, Africa and Latin America and has made inroads in Europe. China’s BRI investments have been criticized by outside groups for not assessing environmental and social impacts, lacking financial transparency and leaving some governments struggling to pay for costly infrastructure.,""The reason there's so much enthusiasm is that countries do want a choice,"" Singh said. ""For a long time. China has been the only game in town for many of these countries, and in many cases, they have buyers regret."",Last year the administration promised to include details of some initial projects during the formal launch of the initiative, originally scheduled for early 2022.,

“We will have more details to come in the coming months on how to continue to implement this initiative, and the projects the U.S. government is investing in with allies and partners,” Jean-Pierre said to VOA Thursday. “This is something that the president is committed to.”,Biden’s Indo-Pacific strategy promises steps to deepen America’s existing treaty alliances with Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand. It also aims to strengthen relationships with regional partners such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Pacific Islands.,Continuing Trump’s approach, the administration is putting strong emphasis on the Quad – a regional grouping among the U.S., India, Japan and Australia.,Much of the strategy rests on the presumption of what the other actors will do, according to Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson Institute's Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia.,“Japan and South Korea should get along, ASEAN should remain central, India should play a bigger role,” she told VOA, pointing out that with ,, New Delhi may not be able to accept that challenge.,The strategy also aims to strengthen deterrence of military threats, with Japan and South Korea to pursue denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

It has also raised the possibility of restarting nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile tests.,While the Biden administration is not offering greater access to American markets, it has been handing out military deals.,Earlier this month, the administration approved a possible $100 million sale of equipment and services to Taiwan to “sustain, maintain and improve” its Patriot missile defense system.,The sale is in line with the Indo-Pacific Strategy goal of supporting Taipei’s self-defense capabilities in hopes of promoting peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. However, it has triggered an angry threat of retaliation from Beijing, which claims the democratically self-governed Taiwan as its breakaway province.,Earlier this month, the administration also approved the potential sale of F-15ID aircraft and related equipment to Indonesia in a deal valued at up to $13.9 billion, despite human rights concerns that have delayed previous arms sales to the country. The last arms deal made by Washington and Jakarta was in 2011.,Other deals include AUKUS, the September trilateral security pact with Australia and the United Kingdom to provide Canberra with nuclear-powered submarines.,More deals are expected and sharper contours of the Indo-Pacific Strategy may take shape as Biden hosts ASEAN leaders in Washington in the coming months and travels to the region for summits later in the year.",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-indo-pacific-strategy-short-on-trade-incentives-experts-say/6449536.html,"

""Then, I saw it for the first time on this university college campus last year, and it was breeding here."", is another example of a butterfly that once only lived in southern Taiwan, and can now be found all over the island, he said.,The changes come as temperatures in East and Southeast Asia have risen more rapidly than the global average in recent decades, Chan said.,""There are many more places where tropical butterflies and other insects can breed, so that's why we're seeing this northward migration, or dispersal behavior,"" he said.,Hsu said the butterflies didn't actually migrate, however; rather, their habitats are expanding due to rising temperatures.,""Once upon a time, the more northerly areas were colder, and not suitable for them to settle in, but they are suitable now, because temperatures have risen,"" Hsu said.,""The north is warming at a higher rate than the south, meaning the difference in temperatures between north and south has been reduced,"" he said.

,"BEIJING — At the height of the Cold War, U.S. President Richard Nixon flew into communist China’s center of power for a visit that, over time, would transform U.S.-China relations and , in ways that were unimaginable at the time.,The relationship between China and the United States was always going to be a challenge, and after half a century of ups and downs, is more fraught than ever. The Cold War is long over, but on both sides there are fears ,could be beginning. ,Despite repeated Chinese disavowals, America worries that the democratic-led world that triumphed over the Soviet Union ,by the authoritarian model of a powerful and still-rising China.,“The U.S.-China relationship has always been contentious but one of necessity,” said Oriana Skylar Mastro, a China expert at Stanford University. “Perhaps 50 years ago the reasons were mainly economic. Now they are mainly in the security realm. But the relationship has never — and will never — be easy.” ,Nixon landed in Beijing on a gray winter morning 50 years ago on Monday. Billboards carried slogans such as “Down with American Imperialism,” part of the upheaval under the Cultural Revolution that banished intellectuals and others to the countryside and subjected many to public humiliation and brutal and even deadly attacks in the name of class struggle.,Nixon’s 1972 trip, which included meetings with Chairman Mao Zedong and a visit to the Great Wall, led to the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979 and the parallel severing of formal ties with Taiwan, which the U.S. had recognized as the government of China after the communists took power in Beijing in 1949.,Premier Zhou Enlai’s translator wrote in a memoir that, to the best of his recollection, Nixon said, “This hand stretches out across the Pacific Ocean in friendship” as he shook hands with Zhou at the airport.,For both sides, it was a friendship born of circumstances, rather than natural allegiances.,China and the Soviet Union, formerly communist allies, had split and even clashed along their border in 1969, and Mao saw the United States as a potential counterbalance to any threat of a Soviet invasion.,Nixon, embroiled in the Watergate scandal at home, was seeking to isolate the Soviet Union and exit a prolonged and bloody Vietnam War that had divided American society. He hoped that China, an ally of communist North Vietnam in its battle with the U.S.-backed South, could play a role in resolving the conflict. ,The U.S. president put himself “in the position of supplicant to Beijing,” said June Teufel Dreyer, a Chinese politics specialist at the University of Miami. Chinese state media promoted the idea that a “prosperous China would be a peaceful China” and that the country was a huge market for American exports, she said.,It would be decades before that happened. First, the U.S. became a huge market for China, propelling the latter’s meteoric rise from an impoverished nation to the world’s second largest economy.,Nixon’s visit was a “pivotal event that ushered in China’s turn outward and subsequent rise globally,” said the University of Chicago’s Dali Yang, the author of numerous books on Chinese politics and economics.,Two years after Mao’s death in 1976, new leader Deng Xiaoping ushered in an era of partial economic liberalization, creating a mix of state-led capitalism and single-party rule that has endured to this day.,China’s wealth has enabled ,, which the U.S. and its allies see as a threat. The Communist Party says it seeks only to defend its territory. That includes, however, trying to control islands also claimed by Japan in the East China Sea and by Southeast Asian nations in the South China Sea, home to crucial shipping lanes and natural resources.,The military has sent a growing number of warplanes on training missions toward Taiwan, a source of friction with the United States. China claims the self-governing island off its east coast as its territory. The U.S. supplies Taiwan with military equipment and warns China against any attempt to take it by force.,Still, Nixon’s trip to China was touted afterward as the signature foreign policy achievement of an administration that ended in ignominy with Watergate.,Embarking on the process of bringing China back into the international fold was the right move, but the past half-century has yet to put relations on a stable track, said Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese history and modern politics at Oxford University.,“The U.S. and China have still failed to work out exactly how they will both fit into a world where they both have a role, but find it increasingly hard to accommodate each other,” he said.,Chinese officials and scholars see the Nixon visit as a time when the two countries sought communication and mutual understanding despite their differences. Zhu Feng, the dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University, said the same approach is key to overcoming the current impasse.,“The commemoration of Nixon’s visit tells us whether we can draw a kind of power from history,” he said. ,Though his trip to China gave the U.S. leverage in its Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union, America now faces a new geopolitical landscape — with echoes of the past.,The Soviet Union is gone, but the Russian and Chinese leaders, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, are , as they push back against U.S. pressure over their authoritarian ways. The Vietnam War is over, but America once again finds its society divided, this time over the pandemic response and the last presidential election.,U.S. President Joe Biden has said he wants a more predictable , but major differences over trade and human rights make mutual understanding elusive. The prospect of long-term stability in ties raised by Nixon’s visit seems to be ever farther out of reach. ,“China-U.S. relations are terrible,” said Xiong Zhiyong, a professor of international relations at China Foreign Affairs University. “There are indeed people hoping to improve relations, but it is utterly difficult to achieve.” ",https://www.voanews.com/a/years-after-nixon-visit-us-china-ties-as-fraught-as-ever/6451925.html,"

,"Russia’s decision to send troops into two separatist enclaves in eastern Ukraine is forcing a difficult choice for China, which has aligned itself closer with Moscow but could face blowback if it is seen as supporting the unilateral redrawing of international borders, analysts say.,The government of Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday formally recognized the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics and ordered what it called “peacekeepers” into the contested regions. The moves followed a fiery speech in which Putin questioned Ukraine’s very statehood, further raising concern he is planning a large-scale invasion.,The situation is tricky for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who earlier this month declared a “no limits” partnership with Russia following a meeting with Putin. The meeting was the latest evidence Russia and China have drawn closer as both attempt to counter U.S. global influence.,But the Ukraine issue is already testing how far that enhanced partnership can go. Analysts say China is likely concerned about foreign turmoil that could impact its economy, especially during a sensitive year of domestic political maneuvering meant to shape what is expected to be Xi’s indefinite rule.,China, which has long insisted it opposes interference in other countries’ internal affairs, may also be worried about its international reputation taking a hit.,On Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the Munich Security Conference that the sovereignty of all nations should be respected. “Ukraine is no exception,” he added.,In recent weeks, China has called for restraint on all sides in Ukraine, as well as a return to the Minsk Agreements, which were meant to restore peace following a flare-up of violence along the Russia-Ukraine border in 2014.,But by recognizing the two disputed Ukrainian territories, Putin “obliterated” the Minsk Agreements, in the process essentially destroying a key Chinese talking point, says Derek Grossman, a senior analyst who focuses on Asia at the RAND Corporation, a California-based global policy research organization. “All of that is completely out the window if Russia does invade,” Grossman told VOA.,Speaking late Monday at an emergency meeting on Ukraine at the United Nations Security Council, China’s U.N. envoy Zhang Jun issued only brief remarks, calling for all sides to “exercise restraint.” He did not mention the Minsk Agreements.,
,
The speech “reads like a placeholder,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “China hasn’t decided what its policy response should be yet,” she concluded., ,In some ways, the situation mirrors that of 2014, when Russia seized the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine. At the time, China also responded by insisting that Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty should be respected but that the West should consider Russia’s “legitimate security concerns.”,Since then, however, geopolitics has shifted. Not only have U.S.-China ties worsened, China has gotten stronger economically and militarily and is now bolder about challenging U.S. power.,But Ryan Hass, a China scholar at the U.S.-based Brookings Institution, cautioned against assuming China has already chosen to support Russia on the Ukraine issue.,“If there is war in Ukraine, and if China actively attempts to shield Russia from global condemnation, then China may spur a self-harming solidification of blocs” in which China is aligned with “the weakest other major power,” he tweeted.,China may also be reluctant to damage its diplomatic and economic relationship with Europe, which is strongly opposed to a Russian invasion of Ukraine.,“Beijing needs to be helped toward realizing that going all-in on the China-Russia relationship carries more risks than benefits,” Hass said.,Other analysts are more pessimistic. Russia and China may be determined to form a relationship that can overturn large swaths of U.S. dominance, argued Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in an editorial in ,.,“It is really their shared desire to disrupt the international order that creates a common interest,” he said.",https://www.voanews.com/a/china-and-russia-vowed-closer-ties-ukraine-is-challenging-that-/6453572.html,"

,"Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam says the semi-autonomous Chinese city will begin mandatory COVID-19 testing of its 7.5 million people next month.,
,
Lam told reporters Wednesday that Hong Kong will boost its testing capacity to one million tests per day by next month, and that residents will be tested three times during March. She also said the city is aiming to boost its vaccination rate to 90% by next month.,
,
The Asian financial hub is struggling to cope with a surge of new coronavirus cases driven by the highly contagious omicron variant. Since the start of 2022, Hong Kong has recorded more than 53,000 COVID-19 cases and 145 deaths. The surge has pushed the city’s health care system to the point of collapse, with thousands of patients being treated outside public hospitals in the rain and chilly weather. The city is rushing to build isolation facilities to house thousands of coronavirus patients, including the conversion of public housing estates and indoor sport centers.,
,
An , conducted by researchers at the University of Hong Kong predicts the city’s infection rate could soar to 180,000 new cases a day by early next month, with the number of deaths rising to more than 3,200 by mid-May.,
,
Despite the rising numbers of new coronavirus cases, Lam said Hong Kong will continue pursuing a “zero COVID” strategy, similar to that of mainland China, which aims to completely eliminate coronavirus outbreaks.,
,
Lam also said Hong Kong will move the annual school holiday season held from July through August to March and April so school buildings can be converted into testing, isolation and vaccination centers. She also extended a fight ban on at least eight nations classified as high risk, including Britain and the United States, until April 20.,
,
South Korea’s drug regulatory agency announced Wednesday that it has approved the use of Pfizer’s two-dose COVID-19 vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11, the first to be approved for that age group. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said the vaccine was found to be nearly 91% effective in preventing the virus in that age group.,

South Korea is also dealing with an omicron-driven surge of new coronavirus cases, with the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency reporting 171,452 new COVID-19 infections Wednesday, setting a new one-day record.,

,"China's deepening ties with Russia will come with heavy geopolitical and economic consequences should the Ukraine crisis escalate, analysts say.,While the two powers have recently intensified their so-called comprehensive strategic partnership, Beijing has not offered its full support for Moscow's military encirclement of its neighbor.,And there have been signs Beijing is worried that a Russia-Ukraine confrontation might not be in China's national interest while its relationship with the West is deteriorating and its economy is slowing down.,The country called again Friday for a political resolution of the crisis. ""Efforts should be made on the basis of the Minsk-2 agreement to properly treat the reasonable security concerns of all sides including Russia through dialogue and negotiation,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin., reported this week that Beijing is weighing how much it will support Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine. According to people with knowledge of the matter, the report said, China's top leaders have debated how to respond to the crisis without hurting China's own interests.,""I can't see how China could support Russia in any sort of meaningful way and not do rather significant damage to the U.S.-China relationship,"" said Michael Hunzeker, an assistant professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. He spoke to VOA in a telephone interview.,The U.S. has recently strongly criticized China's support for Russia.,National security adviser Jake Sullivan accused China of giving a ""wink and a nod"" to a Russian invasion of Ukraine and said, ""I believe that China will ultimately come to suffer consequences as a result of that in the eyes of the rest of the world, most notably in the eyes of our European partners and allies."",Dustin Walker, a nonresident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA he believed that Europe would see China's support for Putin's brinksmanship on Ukraine as further evidence that China is a systemic rival, leading the region to ""rethink its relationship with China."",A possible Russian-Ukrainian confrontation would also test the relationship between Beijing and Moscow. If China, fearing repercussions for its own economy, were to comply with Western sanctions against Russia, Walker noted, it would be seen by Moscow as an unreliable partner.,Walker pointed out that in the joint statement issued after Xi and Putin met at the Beijing Olympics, China explicitly opposed NATO enlargement for the first time, but didn't mention Ukraine.,That ""has to raise the question whether Putin asked for something that he didn't get from China,"" Walker said.,Experts also note that China did not recognize the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, as it places fighting against separatism at the heart of its national security.,In Beijing's diplomatic parlance, China and Russia maintain a ""comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination."" Russia remains the first and only major country to establish this type of partnership with China, said Craig Singleton, a fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.,With China's economy rapidly cooling, Xi will be focused, at least for the foreseeable future, on maintaining economic stability, which is something that Putin may or may not be inclined to respect as he pursues his interests in Ukraine, Singleton said in an email exchange with VOA. ""China and Russia will find it incredibly difficult to synchronize their strategies,"" he wrote., ,China also has important financial ties with Ukraine. It is Kyiv's largest trading partner, and the two countries have had a strategic partnership since 2011. Ukraine joined China's Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure plan, even before Russia did.,While China is also the EU's largest trading partner, the relationship is believed to be at its lowest point in decades. When Beijing began trying to sanction EU member state Lithuania over its policies toward Taiwan, the EU rallied to Vilnius' defense, suing China for coercive trade practices at the World Trade Organization.,China exports almost 10 times as much to the European Union and Britain as it does to Russia, noted Singleton in a recent article published by ,. He said Xi, in recent months, has personally stepped in to try to soothe relations with Europe because China needs enhanced ties to help it weather the current economic storm.,Some analysts believe that an extended showdown with Moscow over Ukraine could distract the United States from its vaunted ""pivot to Asia,"" leaving China more space to expand its influence in the region.,Hunzeker, the George Mason University professor, acknowledged that such a development would be advantageous to China.

,"A series of new financial agreements between China and Pakistan are signaling a shift in political alignments in the region with implications for South Asian neighbors, the United States and for the economic future of Pakistan itself. ,China and Pakistan issued a joint statement that solidified the growing economic ties between the two nations following a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Imran Khan in Beijing during the Winter Olympic Games. ,The two countries pledged ""bilateral cooperation in areas of economic and technical, industry, investment, infrastructure, space, vaccine, digitalization, standardization, disaster management, culture, sports and vocational education,"" ,. ,The meeting between the two leaders comes in the wake of the U.S-led diplomatic boycott of the Olympic Games to protest the allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, which China denies. ,The high-profile meeting was meant to showcase support for Beijing in this period of diplomatic tension, analysts say. ,""I think Imran Khan's visit really shows support, Pakistan's support, for China in the face of this boycott. So it's a public display of support especially given the number of high-profile ministers who traveled with him to China,"" said Madiha Afzal, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution. ,The diplomatic relationship between Beijing and Islamabad dates to 1951, and the alliance between the two countries was solidified as both countries recognized they had a mutual adversary – India – and sought to contain its dominance in South Asia. ,The first trade agreement between Pakistan and China was signed in 1963 and the economic ties strengthened in 2013 with the establishment of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a collection of Chinese-funded infrastructure projects designed to upgrade Pakistan's infrastructure and improve its economy. CPEC is a part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. ,The economic relationship is not limited to trade and CPEC, as ,, holding more than 27% of Pakistan's debt. ,""China doesn't have friends and allies. China has countries which are indebted to China,"" Aparna Pande, research fellow at the Hudson Institute, told VOA. ,Unemployment and poverty exacerbated by the pandemic have been indicators of Pakistan's economic woes, with its GDP declining by 26.4% in the second quarter of 2020. The Pakistani economy has since partially rebounded. ,Pakistan has been facing currency devaluation and high inflation. Last November, the International Monetary Fund revived a $6 billion bailout for Pakistan's economy originally approved in 2019. ,Some analysts note that the country's unwillingness to undertake significant economic reforms contributes to its deteriorating economy. ,""Pakistan's problem is it doesn't have enough foreign exchange reserves because the economy isn't growing fast enough for it to get money. It is refusing to undertake structural reforms, which would enable the second and third tranches of the IMF and enable other foreign investors to invest money,"" Pande said. ,Tara Kartha, in an ,, an Indian online news outlet, described Pakistan's practice of borrowing from China, paying interest, deferring repayment to other countries such as Saudi Arabia and looking to the IMF for bailouts. ,This is a ""classic debt trap of its own making, only getting worse over the years as Islamabad skips nimbly from one loan to the next. It's beyond bankruptcy. It's a state of collapse,"" Kartha wrote. ,But Afzal, the Brookings Institution fellow, cautioned against concluding too quickly that Chinese loans are bad for the Pakistani economy. ,""It'll depend on the terms of the loans, and China has proven to be a player which … holds Pakistan to the terms of the loans. So Pakistan can't necessarily defer payments on those loans, even if it needs to or wants to,"" Afzal said. ,Some analysts say the Sino-Pakistan joint statement symbolically confirms the growing alliance between China and Pakistan, but that it would not affect the ,. ,The once-close relationship between the two nations has become increasingly estranged because of U.S. allegations that Pakistan harbors and sponsors terrorist groups and Pakistan's frustrations with U.S. drone strikes and what it views as a violation of its sovereignty. ,""Pakistan and the U.S. both have explicitly said that they don't want (the Sino-Pakistani) relationship necessarily to be part of those (lack of dialogue) blocks. The relationship has been strained, but I would not characterize it as strained beyond repair,"" Afzal said. ,""We've made the point all along that it is not a requirement for any country around the world to choose between the United States and China,"" Ned Price, U.S. State Department spokesman, said at a February 2 news briefing. ,When asked for comment on the potential benefits of Sino-Pakistan cooperation, the Pakistani embassy referred VOA to the joint statement, noting the deep economic ties that were announced. The Chinese embassy did not respond to VOA's inquiry. ,But for India, Pande said, the joint statement validates the country's concerns about closer ties between two adversaries. ,""It's a dual threat on India's continental landmass, combined with the threat on India's maritime domain. So for India this just strengthens its belief that Pakistan is very close to China and that China continues to use Pakistan to cause problems for India,"" Pande said. ,

,"On December 30, China's state-owned Xinhua News Agency named the Xuzhou ""China's Happiest City"" for 2021.,The city in eastern China's Jiangsu province boasted dramatic economic growth and enlightened city planning, according to Jiangsu.net, resulting in the kind of blossoming that gains nationwide notice in China.,But within days, Xuzhou's civic pride morphed into mortification when a blogger found a mother of eight chained by the neck to the wall of a hut and exposed to freezing weather. As the Olympic Games progressed in Beijing, the mother's story went viral, and subsequent missteps by Xuzhou authorities drew local accusations of cover-ups and worldwide outrage.,The mother, Xiao Huamei, appeared in a video on Douyin (Chinese TikTok) shot by a blogger who documents unusual families, in this case, one with eight children, seven of them boys. In the video, behind the alleged father and all the youngsters, Chinese netizens spotted a chained woman.,On January 28, the video went viral. Amid the run-up to Lunar New Year festivities and the Beijing Winter Olympics, shocked netizens demanded answers: Who was this woman? Why was she chained up? How can she have eight kids with her husband given China's reproductive controls?,Between January 28 and February 10, local authorities issued four reports on the situation. The muddled accounts stirred further public outcry, and many netizens expressed their suspicions that kidnapping and domestic abuse were central to the woman's case.,Public pressure brought the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to reckoning for a long-hushed-up web of problems, such as the human trafficking resulting from the imbalanced male to female ratio, the result of a cultural preference for boys in a country that restricted families to one child from 1980 to 2013, when the policy began to loosen.,As of Tuesday, China's social media platform Weibo was censoring the tag ""Xiao Huamei,"" and while discussion was allowed, the subject has been blocked from the hot topic list.,An official in the CCP Xuzhou Propaganda Unit told VOA Mandarin that authorities were investigating the case.,Understanding of laws banning domestic abuse ""is relatively weak in rural parts of China, and there's a lack of social governance, resulting in human trafficking,"" the CCP official, who identified himself only as Mr. Xu, said.,""But we are working on it now. Please give us some space to get a clear picture,"" he added,Xuzhou authorities have issued four contradictory reports since the woman was first seen on video.,County-level authorities issued the first two, which emphasized the woman had been diagnosed as mentally ill and dismissed concerns that she was being trafficked.,In the first report, published January 28, the same day the video went viral in China, authorities said the woman, a local resident, was married to a man named Dong Zhimin. The couple had eight children, said the report, which also stressed she had a serious mental illness.,A January 30 report said the woman was a beggar taken in by Dong's father in June 1998. Although the local birth planning unit had performed ""birth control measures"" after the woman bore her first and second child, ""both failed due to her physical condition,On February 7, city-level authorities reversed the second report and gave the woman's name as Xiao Huamei, or ""Little Plum Blossom,"" which in Chinese sounds more like a nickname than a proper name.,This report, the third, said the woman came from a village in southern China's Yunnan province, and in 1996, her mother had asked a woman identified only as Ms. Sang to take her daughter to Jiangsu province for treatment of her mental illness. The daughter disappeared, and Ms. Sang failed to inform Xiao's parents or the local police.,Chinese netizens were not buying what the reports were selling.,""So all the previous investigation reports are lies!"" one netizen said.,""How do you explain the chain on her neck?"" asked another. ""And how did they manage to get married if she's mentally ill?"",""She went missing and no one cared to tell her family? And this is not human trafficking?"" yet another netizen opined.,Facing unrelenting public outcry, the Xuzhou authorities on Thursday released the fourth, and latest, report. In it, they state that Xiao Huamei is a victim of human trafficking, and that three people have been arrested in connection with the case, including her husband, Dong, who has been charged with illegal detention. Ms. Sang and her husband have been charged with human trafficking,Many netizens praised the latest report as a step closer to the truth. Others were angry that the authorities acted only after public outcry. Some still have questions.,""We need follow-ups. What's her age? Where's their marriage license?"" one netizen asked.,""We need to see proof other than a report. If this is not the final investigation and the results are wrong again, someone needs to be held accountable,"" another commenter wrote.,Xu, with the CCP Xuzhou Propaganda Unit, told VOA Mandarin on Friday that social services have the mother and her eight children in care.,Xu said that because of limited time and resources, the first two reports didn't provide clear picture of the facts, which led to the conclusion that she wasn't being trafficked.,""But now we are actively pursuing this case. I hope netizens and media can give us some room to conduct the investigation and not pressure us too hard,"" he said.,Yao Cheng, a former lieutenant colonel of the CCP's Navy Command and a women's right activist, told VOA Mandarin that a third party needs to conduct the investigation to guarantee transparency.,""If the CCP is really confident in itself, it needs to allow other international organizations to conduct the investigation so people will actually believe the result,"" he told VOA. Yao volunteered for the New York-based Women's Rights in China, a nongovernmental organization, from 2007 to 2016.,Yao also pointed out that China's longtime one-child policy has resulted in an imbalanced male to female ratio, especially in rural areas, where people value sons over daughters.,The ""natural sex ratio"" at birth is 105 boys for every 100 girls, ,, because a few extra males are needed to offset their tendency to die at a younger age than females. But in China, the ratio has sometimes exceeded 120 boys for every 100 girls. The result is that in 2020, there were 34.9 million more males than females in China, making it a challenge for men to find a wife, especially in China's rural areas, where gender imbalance is even greater, according to the BBC.,""The gender imbalance has resulted in more human trafficking of women in China's rural areas,"" Yao said. ""Authorities and police usually turn a blind eye to these activities, and some even profit from it.""",https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-netizens-pressure-government-about-case-of-chained-mother-/6444048.html,"

,"China continues to be the top global source of counterfeit products, but it is far from the only major concern regarding pirated goods, according to the annual notorious-markets list released Thursday by the office of the U.S. trade representative.,The coronavirus pandemic, with its resulting restrictions on tourism and movement, has meant some markets known for openly selling counterfeit goods currently have no or very few problematic stores doing business, according to the report.,Such notorious venues include the MBK Shopping Mall, Patpong Street Market and Soi Nana in Thailand, noted the USTR.,Also on the list are other physical markets around the world with long-standing reputations as hubs for fake goods. These include the Central Market in Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh; Anfu Market in China’s Fujian province, which specializes in counterfeit shoes; Beijing’s Silk Market; Palika Bazaar and Tank Road in New Delhi, India; the 80-square-block Tepito in Mexico City; and Moscow’s Dubrovka Market, with an estimated 700 vendors.,The problem is not limited to the developing world. Toronto’s Pacific Mall, regarded as the largest indoor Asian shopping mall in North America, is back on the annual list after cleaning up its act several years ago, according to officials.,The USTR said the mall’s management made efforts, along with law enforcement raids on sellers of alleged counterfeit goods, but since 2018, sales of bogus items have surged “with Pacific Mall management not taking the necessary measures against sellers and law enforcement not prioritizing actions against counterfeit trade. Counterfeit luxury goods, apparel and electronics are reportedly on display or hidden under tables or in back rooms but available upon request.”,Some shops trafficking in fake items have been transitioning from physical stores to e-commerce platforms ""and using the physical storefronts to facilitate the fulfillment of online sales,” said the USTR report. ""Online sellers of counterfeit goods have also increased efforts to evade the anti-counterfeiting processes and systems established by governments and e-commerce platforms by, for example, using social media advertisements and influencers, hidden links and drop shipping schemes.”,Among the most problematic websites: the Baidu Wangpan cloud storage service in China, for sharing pirated movies and television programs; Bukalapak, one of the largest e-commerce markets in Indonesia; e-commerce website and mobile app IndiaMART; Chinese social commerce app Pinduoduo; and the mobile app known as the Netflix of piracy, Popcorn Time.,One of the most vocal in promoting piracy remains the legacy site ThePirateBay.,""Authorities in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom have issued orders blocking access to this site,"" the USTR said. “Right holders report that this site does not respond to any notice-and-takedown requests.”,The annual report scrutinizes the WeChat instant messaging platform, which has more than 1 billion active monthly users.,""WeChat, along with Weixin, which is the China-facing version of WeChat, is reportedly viewed as one of the largest platforms for counterfeit goods in China,” according to the USTR review.,Also of significant concern to the USTR: Rapidgator, which is one of the largest file-sharing websites in the world, and e-commerce platform Taobao, of China’s Alibaba Group.,“The global trade in counterfeit and pirated goods undermines critical U.S. innovation and creativity and harms American workers,” said U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai in a statement. “This illicit trade also increases the vulnerability of workers involved in the manufacturing of counterfeit goods to exploitative labor practices, and the counterfeit goods can pose significant risks to the health and safety of consumers and workers around the world.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-china-remains-global-top-source-of-counterfeit-goods/6446528.html,"

,"China’s social media users have responded mostly positively to the sporting performances of their largest-ever contingent of foreign-born Olympic athletes, while appearing to keep mum on the sensitive issue of whether those athletes were allowed to keep their foreign nationalities.,The Chinese Olympic Committee fielded 30 foreign-born and -raised athletes in its 176-strong delegation for this month’s Winter Games in Beijing, 28 of them in its men’s and women’s ice hockey teams. The two other athletes are the highest-profile members of China’s foreign-origin contingent: freestyle skier Eileen Gu and figure skater Zhu Yi, both U.S.-born.,Eighteen-year-old Gu has won adulation in China by securing two golds and a silver, with her second gold coming in Friday’s freeski halfpipe final. Zhu did not win a medal and the Chinese men’s and women’s ice hockey teams did not reach the quarterfinal knockout stages of their tournaments.,Canadian-born ice hockey player Ethan Werek is one of the Chinese men’s team’s 15 foreign-born players, of whom 11 hail from Canada, three from the U.S. and one from Russia. Most of them have Chinese ancestry, while Werek is one of five who do not.,Speaking by phone to VOA in Istanbul on Thursday as he was en route back to North America, Werek said he had seen only positive comments about his ice hockey team role as he translated posts made on his Weibo account. Weibo is the most popular Chinese microblogging site.,“There were lots of positive messages from Chinese fans thanking me and thanking our team. I just wish I knew how to respond properly and thank them truly for the opportunity to represent China,” said Werek, who does not read Mandarin.,Werek’s observation was consistent with posts seen by VOA on the Weibo accounts of two of his U.S.-born teammates Jeremy Smith and Jake Chelios, who also are not of Chinese origin.,Goalkeeper Smith, who injured his leg in China’s 7-2 loss to Canada in Tuesday’s qualification playoff and had to be taken to a hospital, posted a Chinese-language farewell message to his fans later that day. It elicited hundreds of comments, some in English, expressing admiration for his efforts and wishing him a speedy recovery., , , ,Chelios, a defender, had posted a Chinese message to his Weibo account a day earlier, describing his team’s initial 5-0 loss to Canada in a February 13 preliminary round group game as unfortunate and saying “we must do our best” in the qualification playoff.,“Winning or losing is not important, but you let us see the future of China’s ice hockey,” replied one Weibo user in English. “We will pay attention to you and love you.”, ,The foreign-origin ice hockey players likely endeared themselves to Chinese fans by respecting Chinese people and conventions, said Susan Brownell, an American research specialist on Chinese sports and an anthropology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.,“They demonstrated a commitment to China just by moving there several years ago to play for a Chinese club. Under circumstances like this, I do think that Chinese people can be honored and flattered that you have chosen to represent China,” Brownell told VOA.,Brownell said Chinese fans also likely did not expect the men’s or women’s ice hockey teams to be medal contenders. They were the , in their respective tournaments and secured automatic berths by virtue of China being the host nation.,The Chinese women’s team won two and lost two of its preliminary round group games. The men’s team lost its three preliminary round group games and its qualification playoff, but its preliminary round loss to Germany was by a narrow 3-2 margin.,VOA did not observe any Chinese social media posts criticizing the foreign-origin ice hockey players, but Brownell said there is a possibility that such comments may have been censored.,Zhu, the 19-year-old figure skater, drew a deluge of harsh comments from Chinese netizens after falling during her team and single skating events, some telling her to “,.” U.S. and Chinese news reports said China’s internet censors responded by blocking the Mandarin hashtag ""Zhu Yi has fallen” and removing some of the most incendiary posts.,Zhu is the only one of the 30 foreign-origin Chinese Olympic athletes whom the , has confirmed to have renounced foreign citizenship. She switched her allegiance from the U.S. to China in 2018.,It does not appear that any of the other 29 athletes have done the same, despite Article 8 of China’s , saying that a person naturalizing as a Chinese citizen “shall not retain foreign nationality.” Athletes must be a national of the country they represent under ,.,VOA did not observe any Weibo posts discussing the sensitive question of whether Chinese authorities bent the law to allow foreign athletes to compete for China as dual nationals.,Ice hockey player Chelios told ,last week that he and several of his teammates still have U.S. passports. Smith, in an interview with U.S. outlet , earlier this month, said he “told China” that he would “never” give up his U.S. passport and “they said that’s fine.”,In a sign that Chinese two-time Olympic champion Gu also has not renounced her U.S. citizenship, an , article published last year in multiple languages, ‘Five things you didn't know about Eileen Gu,’ ends with a sentence saying that she has “dual nationality.”,The “dual nationality” reference can be seen in the ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,and ,versions of the article. It also had appeared in the ,version of the article until it was removed on Feb. 9 or 10, shortly after Gu won her first gold and shot into the international spotlight. The ,version ends with a sentence saying Gu is “active in both China and the U.S.” rather than referring to her as a dual national.,The International Olympic Committee did not answer a VOA question about why it removed the reference from the English version of the Gu profile.,Gu has not responded directly to reporters seeking confirmation of whether she is a dual national. In a February 8 Beijing news conference, she repeated a statement that she has made before, saying that she is Chinese when she is in China, and American when she is in the United States.,When asked by VOA if he has renounced his Canadian citizenship, Chinese ice hockey forward Werek also did not respond directly, instead saying “when I’m in China, I’m Chinese.” Smith made a similar statement later when German news agency , asked him to clarify his U.S. citizenship status following the Chinese men’s team’s 8-0 loss to the U.S., cited other North American-origin Chinese ice hockey players as telling reporters in Beijing that they were not allowed to comment on the issue.,“I think this is an experiment for China,” Brownell said, referring to its recruitment of the foreign-origin athletes. “If it works, then a government document declaring an official change in [naturalization] policy will come out in future,” she predicted.,Werek said he sees more work with the Chinese men’s national team in his future. Its next big challenge will be trying to qualify for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy, where China will not have an automatic berth as it had this time.,The disappointment of the Chinese men’s team with its Beijing 2022 result shows that it believes it can do better, Werek said.,“There were games that we could have won. So our expectation going into 2026 is that we’re going to be a team that will compete, and we’re excited for that.""",https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-netizens-deliver-mostly-positive-verdict-on-china-s-foreign-origin-olympians/6447240.html,"

,"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday he is ""determined"" that his human rights chief should conduct a ""credible"" visit to China's semi-autonomous Xinjiang province, where ethnic Uyghur and Turkic Muslim minorities live.,""It is in the interest of China -- if they are convinced that they are not doing what people accuse them to do -- it is in the interest of China to have a credible visit of the high commissioner, and we will be doing everything we can to make sure that it happens,"" Guterres said. ""If it won't happen, of course the high commissioner will take the decisions that correspond to her mandate."",The U.N. chief made the remarks in Germany at the Munich Security Conference, in response to a question from the conference chairman, Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger.,U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has been trying to negotiate a visit to Xinjiang for the past three years. Chinese officials said recently that she would be allowed to come to have an exchange, but not an investigation. Beijing denies it violates the rights of Uyghurs and says it is combating terrorism.,Rights groups and the U.S. government accuse Beijing of serious abuses of Uyghur rights, including torture, forced sterilization, sexual violence and forced separation of children. They are subjected to widespread surveillance and more than a million Uyghurs have been sent to detention camps.,China has dismissed the accusations as groundless and says Xinjiang enjoys stability, development and prosperity. Beijing has also lashed out at other nations for interfering in its internal affairs.,Guterres visited Beijing earlier this month as a guest of the International Olympic Committee for the opening ceremony of the Winter Games. He also had a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during which his spokesman said he told them he expects the government to allow a ""credible visit"" for Bachelet.,""What I have been telling the Chinese authorities, and I'm telling publicly, is that in Xinjiang human rights must be fully respected, but not only human rights must be fully respected, policies must guarantee that the identity – the cultural and religious identity of minorities is respected -- and at the same time they have opportunities to be part of the society as a whole,"" the secretary-general said in Munich.,Human Rights Watch welcomed the U.N. chief's remarks.,""These are Guterres' strongest remarks on the human rights crisis in Xinjiang to date,"" Human Rights Watch U.N. Director Louis Charbonneau told VOA. ""Obviously a ""credible"" visit by the high commissioner has to mean unfettered and unmanaged access in Xinjiang, which the secretary-general clearly recognizes."",Charbonneau noted that the Chinese government has not yet been willing to grant that.,""The Chinese have said they've maintained a clear and consistent position, and there are no signs of change of heart in Beijing,"" he said. ""But whether or not the high commissioner visits China, she should publish her long-delayed report on Xinjiang immediately. There's no reason to keep denying member states her office's assessment of the massive and widespread human rights abuses in Xinjiang, which we at Human Rights Watch have determined amount to crimes against humanity."",A report on the situation of the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities has been expected from Bachelet's office for some time, but so far it has not come out.",https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-determined-human-rights-chief-visit-xinjiang-/6447739.html,"

,"As Russia builds up forces along Ukraine's borders and Chinese officials seek to punish Lithuania for opening a door to Taiwan, the heads of the Lithuanian parliament's defense and foreign affairs committees called on their allies in Washington for support.,Their message was clear: Lithuania is holding the line against two of America's most powerful challengers and that U.S. support is critical to its success in defending against aggression from Moscow and Beijing.,""This week in Washington, we're here to address two issues. One is security, and it's about Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic region. The other one is China. Those are trade issues, but not only trade issues. It's about our security as well,"" Laima Liucija Andrikiene, chair of the parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, told VOA as she and her colleagues wrapped up a weeklong trip to Washington on Feb. 3.,The delegation was made up of four lawmakers in charge of national security, defense and foreign affairs committees in the Lithuanian parliament, known as the Seimas. They met members of both the Senate and House Baltic caucuses, as well as Democratic Senator Bob Menendez and Republican Senator James E. Risch, the chairman and ranking senior minority member of U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, among others.,No media source currently available,""The biggest thing happening right now is Russian buildup around Ukraine, it creates so-called strategic uncertainty, which means different scenarios are possible,"" said Laurynas Kasciunas, chairman of the National Security and Defense Committee. Whether through negotiations or the ""military scenario,"" Russia's goals are the same, he said.,He said Moscow wants not only to ""have the veto right"" to prevent any NATO enlargement to the east, but also to ""create a two- or three-tiered NATO, with second-class membership for the Baltic states,"" meaning Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia would remain in NATO formally but ""without military exercises in our region, without NATO deployment in our region."",""We are against that, we reject that, it's very good for the U.S. and NATO to respond and say they reject this as well,"" he said.,Kasciunas also voiced concern about Belarus, his country's neighbor to the east, which he said has ""lost its sovereignty and neutrality"" since President Alexander Lukashenko turned to Moscow for help when threatened by mass protests over a disputed 2020 election.,Lithuania has since become a safe haven for activists fleeing Belarus, including exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and her children.,No media source currently available,Russia's deployment of troops into Belarus as part of a buildup for a potential invasion of Ukraine demonstrates how quickly Lithuania — a NATO member state — could be subjected to similar pressure, Kasciunas said. ""If two years ago Lukashenko could have 48 hours neutrality, now he [presents] zero neutrality."",Lithuania this week welcomed decisions made by Germany and the Netherlands to increase the number of troops deployed to Lithuania. U.S. help is also critical, Kasciunas said. He described what this help could look like.,""We have now a rotating military battalion, but we need more combat-ready, more integrated into our national system,"" he said. Even more importantly, ""no gaps"" between rotations, he said.,No media source currently available,Dovile Sakaliene, another National Security and Defense Committee member who was not part of the delegation, said she agrees. ""Deterrence is much cheaper than defense,"" she said in a phone interview from Lithuania.,""We feel like West Berlin in Cold War times,"" Kasciunas said. ""We have only a small corridor, the Suwalki Gap, which links us Baltic states with the rest of the NATO system via Poland. Just like NATO defended and deterred the Soviets in West Berlin, we're also asking NATO to deter possible attacks in the Baltics."",Kasciunas also recounted some of the decisions made during what he called ""a year of anti-communism fight"" that angered Beijing, beginning with a strong investment screening mechanism aimed at protecting Lithuania's strategic assets and ending with an agreement to let Taiwan establish a representative office using the name Taiwan.,""They decided to punish us, not only to punish us but also to prevent others from following suit,"" Kasciunas said.,""They not only banned our exports to China, but also Chinese export to Lithuania, which created a lot of problems for companies that depended on Chinese import for their production. And they also harassed international companies, which in their supply chain had some small Lithuanian element, especially German companies.,""They want to make Lithuania a noncredible financial partner, not attractive to foreign direct investment,"" he said.,No media source currently available,Andrikiene, the Foreign Affairs Committee chair, pointed out that Lithuania became an independent state after 50 years of Soviet occupation 32 years ago. ""Without allies, like-minded countries, other democracies from whichever region of the world, we simply wouldn't have survived, let alone become a successful European Union and NATO member state,"" she said.,The presence and concrete support of worldwide democracies is critical, the Lithuanian lawmakers say, if they are to rally their own population and stand up to China's attempts to isolate the country and harm its image.,One way the U.S. could help is by connecting their northeastern European state with countries providing market access in the Asia-Pacific region, Andrikiene said.,""The United States maintains a dialogue with the Indo-Pacific region, and we were asking for their expertise, their experience and their support for Lithuania. That would be a very concrete assistance and support in addition to political support and resolutions,"" she said.,Kori Schake, a senior fellow and director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, told VOA in an exchange of emails that China ""is draconian in response to small states' bravery, fearing that if they aren't made examples of, others will also gain the courage to resist China's intimidation."",Ensuring Lithuania's success, she said, ""is the right response"" because it demonstrates solidarity with frontline states that dare to question and spotlight Chinese strategic intentions and practices.,""Same for Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and other countries China is trying to intimidate,"" she said.",https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuania-looks-to-us-for-help-against-china-russia-/6436294.html,"

,"Working with the famous Chinese dissident Harry Wu, long-term China observer Orville Schell first encountered forced labor in China three decades ago. Pretending to be a businessman interested in items for export to America, Wu and reporters from the CBS News show ,. ,More recently, China has repeatedly denied the current use of Uyghur forced labor; evidence continues to point to the contrary.,Last month, Schell brought the issue to the fore again when , published an article, ,based on an edited version of Schell's diary from that investigation with Wu.,VOA Mandarin spoke with Schell about what's happening today in China. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. ,A: You couldn't do it today. You wouldn't even get off the plane. It's unthinkable. You can understand why the Communist Party under (President Xi Jinping) increased control, because they're aware that if they don't control everybody in China and foreigners outside China as well, they will start doing things like this. They are becoming more savvy, and the logic of their savviness is more control.,A: I don't particularly like the use of the word ""genocide."" I don't think it describes what's actually happening. Genocide does so irrevocably (go) back to the Holocaust in Europe during the '30s and '40s.,I think what's going on in Xinjiang is quite different, not less pernicious in a way. But it has less to do with actually killing people, as the Germans did in the labor camps, and more to do with something that is very uniquely Chinese Communist, namely trying to change the thinking, religion, the cultural habits of the Uyghurs, the Muslims, the other minority in China.,That is a new kind of technocracy, which we are not familiar with. It's very uniquely Chinese. It needs a new name. I think it's very dangerous, and (it) certainly violates many fundamental principles of individual rights that liberal democratic countries cherish, but it is not a cutout of Holocaust and genocidal experiences we've seen in Rwanda, Armenia and Europe.,A: Will this kind of techno autocratic ""thought reform"" and detention sort of experience work? I don't know the answer to that. It probably will work in the short run. Whether it'll work in the long run is another question.,Because if you believe as I do, human beings fundamentally would like to have lives as free as possible within a reasonable social contract. Then you have to assume what's going on in Xinjiang is really making people unhappy. Everybody is scared.,And that is the power of the Chinese Communist Party – people are scared. They don't want to talk out, they don't want to get in trouble. But history shows that governments that rule by fear rather than by assent tend to be short-lived and not tremendously durable.,A: It's doubly difficult because what the Chinese Communist Party is doing is not transparent.,I think some camps are closing down, I think there are people who were released last year.,I think the Chinese Communist Party does listen to what foreigners say, what the foreign media says, foreign governments say. But on the other hand, I think they're very reluctant to let go of these tools of control.,This is what the Communist Party knows how to do. If there is a problem, control is always the answer.,A: I think it certainly has a lot to do with the character and logical nature of Xi Jinping. He was a child of the Cultural Revolution, and we now get a return to the past.,He never went abroad, doesn't speak a foreign language, does not feel comfortable with foreign companies. He is not a cosmopolitan person. He is very insecure, very insular, he's very ""tu."" (""unsophisticated"" in Mandarin Chinese),So he didn't want to become absorbed into the global order. He wanted to go above it. Xi Jinping just happened to come at a time China did have acquired sufficiency and power.,I feel, having watched (China) for a long, long time – I first started studying (it) in the late 1950s – I feel (Xi's failure to adapt to change) is one of the greatest tragedies in modern history.,China, just as it gained the power and wealth, and the influence, the ability to be respected by the world, instead of joining the world order, and enjoying this immense success that Chinese people have accomplished, it is now making everybody feel uncomfortable, it's antagonizing one country after another, and it's rallying all of the states in Asia into a very serious tension, and possible military clashes toward a war. That is one of the great tragedies of any country in the past century, particularly in Asia. , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/years-on-china-observer-schell-sees-return-to-past/6438846.html,"

""We permanently feel U.S. strong political and practical support in our dispute with China over its systemic violations of international trade rules,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a press release.,No media source currently available,The dispute began in 2020 when Lithuania's new government pledged to support what it called ""freedom fighters"" in Taiwan and criticized Beijing's human rights record in Hong Kong and Tibet.,In May 2021, Lithuanian lawmakers approved a resolution that described China's treatment of its Uyghur minority as ""genocide."" China has rejected such accusations.,In November of last year, Taiwan officially opened the representative office in Vilnius. Its director, Eric Huang, said the goal was the ""strengthening of [the] bilateral relationship comprehensively between Taiwan and Lithuania."",Lithuania said the opening did not affect its policy toward China or imply any official recognition of Taiwan as independent from Beijing. The move, however, stoked fury in Beijing.,""From the perspective of Beijing, it's crossing a line, a real red line on how they approach Taiwan. And this is what led later to Beijing downgrading its embassy in Lithuania,"" Grzegorz Stec of the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies said in a recent interview with VOA.,In December, China effectively blocked Lithuanian imports by delisting it as a country of origin, meaning goods can't clear Chinese customs, while pressing multinational businesses to sever ties with the Baltic country.,""And that works not only in some cases for goods that are produced in Lithuania but also goods that include in their supply chain components produced in Lithuania. Also, the European exports that have been transited through Lithuanian ports, they have also been affected,"" Stec said., ,The European Union accuses China of threatening the integrity of its single market and has launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization.,""We are stepping forward to defend the EU's rights,"" EU Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters January 27.,""Since December 1, Chinese customs are banning Lithuanian imports from the Chinese market. ... Chinese companies are canceling orders from Lithuania. China is also cutting its exports to Lithuania. Moreover, China is putting pressure on international companies to abandon the use of Lithuanian components in their production,"" Dombrovskis said.,It likely will take years for the WTO challenge to be resolved. In the meantime, the EU is working on legal instruments to counter coercive practices.,""This could include really targeting or restricting access for companies from a specific country from the single market. Right now, we don't really have a clear instrument for doing that,"" Stec told VOA.,The Taiwan government has offered Lithuania a $1 billion credit program and a separate $200 million fund to boost trade. Lithuania has donated hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 vaccines to Taiwan.,The United States has also stepped in to make up the shortfall caused by China's blockade. The U.S. Export-Import Bank signed a $600 million export credit agreement with Lithuania, focusing on manufacturing, business services and renewable energy.,But it's not just about money, Stec said. ""Symbolic involvement [by the U.S.] of course supports Lithuania by showing that it's not isolated in its moves. At the same time, it also makes it harder to unravel the situation because it once again puts it in the spotlight."",U.S. officials also held talks in Brussels on joint measures to tackle economic coercion., ,China, meanwhile, accuses Lithuania of ""betrayal."",""The issue between China and Lithuania is a bilateral issue between China and Lithuania, not between China and Europe. We urge Lithuania to correct its mistakes immediately, and not act as a pawn of Taiwan independence separatist and anti-China forces. We also remind the EU to distinguish right from wrong and be alert to Lithuania's attempts to hijack China-EU relations,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters January 27.",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-counters-china-s-economic-coercion-against-lithuania-in-taiwan-dispute-/6425655.html,"

,"In subtropical Taiwan, the closest pile of icy snow is a serving of bàobīng, a sweet fruity dessert.,Yet when the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games open Friday, four Taiwanese athletes will compete under a name — Chinese Taipei — that is rarely used and without displaying their red flag with a white sun on a blue rectangle in one corner.,Skiers Lee Wen-yi and Ho Ping-jui will compete in the women’s and men’s slalom, respectively. Lin Sin-rong will rocket downhill in the women’s single luge. And, like other speedskaters, Huang Yu-ting, 33, will participate certain of the Dutch team’s dominance.,“When I’m meeting people, I’ll tell them I’m from Taiwan, because if you tell people you’re from Chinese Taipei, nobody knows where you’re from, you can’t find it on Google,” Lee said of her homeland.,There are almost no real training facilities for winter sports on the self-governing island and the COVID-19 pandemic has kept Taiwan’s athletes from training abroad. They’ve kept in shape using alternative training methods as they prepare for the Olympics. ,Luger Lin, 23, has powered along the nation’s mountain highways on in-line skates. She trains on one of Taiwan’s ice rinks to perfect the launch sequence needed to start the luge. With spiked gloves, she works the ice as recreational skaters glide by.,“On the ice rink, I will just practice starts by [paddling] the ice with my gloves over and over, it’s quite repetitive,” she told VOA Mandarin last week. ,Alpine skier Ho, 24, has trained in snow-blessed Austria since his middle school days. For these Games, however, he’s been bicycling and hitting the gym to maintain the lung capacity and muscles his event demands.,“We almost escaped back to Taiwan during early 2020 before a lockdown in Europe, because at that time, people’s understanding was that the COVID-19 virus would severely damage your lungs,” Ho, who now lives in Taipei, told VOA Mandarin.,“For an athlete, an injury like that will end your career,” he said.,Lee, 19, faces a similar challenge. The product of a skiing family, Lee’s father, Lee Yong-de, was one of Taiwan’s few professional skiers who reigned in the 1980s. He now owns an indoor ski training center, where his daughter maintains her competitive form using two machines that simulate the alpine tracks of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia and the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics in South Korea.,“These machines helped me tremendously,” Lee said. “When I went to the U.S. for training in August 2021, it’s like I’ve never left the tracks after a year and a half living in Taiwan, where you see zero snow.”,Lee believes she’s benefitted from the machines. “I think the machines have low tolerance for error, so I actually have to perfect my movement to finish the simulated tracks on them.”,But she needed more to qualify for the Games, so Lee and her father crisscrossed Europe last autumn so she could compete in qualifying events in Lithuania, Bosnia and Cyprus until December.,“I did a total of 33 races in less than two months, one race per 1.4 days,” Lee told VOA Mandarin. ,During their training trip, her father, who is also her coach, maintained close contact with the Chinese Taipei Ski Association, which is responsible for entering athletes for the Games. ,“All the hard work didn’t go in vain, and now I have a spot in this year’s Olympic Games,” Lee added. ,While Beijing operates sports-centered boarding schools that are partially state-funded to train China’s rising Olympians, Taiwanese athletes usually rely on family funding for training until they start to participate in international events. At that point, the Taiwan Sports Administration and commercial sponsorships begin to offset the cost of training.,But for athletes who are training for winter sports that do not bring in tourist dollars or other revenue to the subtropical island, money is as hard to find as snow.,Taiwan will not send any government officials to the Beijing Winter Olympics this year, and the Taiwan Sports Administration said Jan. 28 that its delegation would not take part in the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics “due to tense epidemiological situation and other factors.”,China considers Taiwan a breakaway province, and a Taiwanese official told Reuters that self-governing Taiwan feared Beijing could use the events to assert its jurisdiction over the island by putting ,, which is officially a special administrative region of China.,This year’s Winter Olympics is also clouded by a U.S.-led diplomatic boycott, as well as possible air pollution, ,.,The Taiwanese team members who spoke to VOA Mandarin said they would refrain from commenting on political topics. ,“I asked my athletes to focus on the Games and stay out of politics,” said Lee Yong-de, who coaches his daughter Lee Wen-yi, because “separating the two makes everyone happy.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/snow-free-subtropical-taiwan-fielding-team-for-winter-games/6424608.html,"

,"The glamour-girl-next-door image of Eileen Gu holding Lunar New Year treats illuminates bus stop ads throughout Beijing. ,If you didn't see those, you can hear China's medal hopeful narrating a commercial for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in Mandarin. ,And on newsstands, the freestyle skier is the cover model of this month's Vogue Chinese edition. ,Gu, China's unofficial face of the Winter Olympics, is everywhere. And that omnipresence belies her origins in the United States, which raises questions about her citizenship as China does not allow dual citizenship. ,Born on September 3, 2003, in San Francisco, California, to an American father and a Chinese mother who emigrated from China, Gu started training in the U.S. at the age of 8 and began competing in major skiing events in 2018 as an American. ,On June 7, 2019, however, Gu announced her , to represent her mother's homeland in the 2022 Winter Olympics. , ""I am proud of my heritage, and equally proud of my American upbringings,"" Gu wrote. ""The opportunity to help inspire millions of young people where my mom was born during the 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help to promote the sport I love."",Some experts say the reason behind Gu's decision may not be that simple. ,Besides her sports career, Gu is also a model who has appeared on the cover of Vogue Hong Kong and Vogue China. She has deals with luxury brands including Louis Vuitton and Tiffany. ,Lisa Pike Masteralexis, professor in the Mark H. McCormack Department of Sport Management at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, told VOA Mandarin in an email, ""Considering her goal of being a decorated Olympian, a role model, a fashion model, and with the growing market conditions in China, it appears to be a savvy move by Eileen Gu and her agency, IMG."" The agency represents top fashion industry names such as Alek Wek and Bella Hadid.,Susan Brownell, an anthropology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis with expertise in Chinese sports and the Olympic Games, told VOA Mandarin during a virtual interview, ""What's interesting about her is that she does have a number of major sponsorships, and so it appears that representing China is actually appealing to those sponsors, which is a rather new development that you would have, you know, a Chinese American athlete who chose to represent China and was still appealing to sponsors."" ,IMG did not respond to a request for comments by VOA Mandarin. ,Gu's decision to represent China stirred questions about her citizenship status. ,One of Gu's main sponsors, Red Bull, used to have a message on its website that read: ""At the age of 15, US-born Gu decided to give up her American passport and naturalize as a Chinese citizen in order to compete for China in Beijing – because Chinese law doesn't recognize dual nationality."" ,After the Wall Street Journal attempted to confirm Gu's citizenship status in January, Red Bull removed the message. ,VOA Mandarin messaged Gu and her sports agent but neither responded. ,China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected VOA Mandarin's request for comments. ,The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and General Administration of Sports of China directed VOA Mandarin to the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC). But VOA Mandarin's emails to the COC bounced back.,, ""1. Any competitor in the Olympic Games must be a national of the country of the NOC which is entering such competitor. 2. All matters relating to the determination of the country which a competitor may represent in the Olympic Games shall be resolved by the IOC Executive Board."",Gu also needs to comply with International Ski Federation (FIS) and National Olympic Committee rules. The FIS lists her as a ,.,""A skier must be licensed by their home country to represent that nation, so Eileen Gu must have officially changed her license. According to Chinese media reports she did this in 2019 when she was 15,"" Masteralexis said. ,Although Masteralexis thinks Gu is following both the IOC and FIS rules, she said, ""It has been reported in Chinese media going back 2-3 years that Eileen Gu was granted Chinese citizenship and China does not recognize dual citizenship. The US does recognize dual citizenship, so one does wonder if China has created an exception for Gu."" ,In an , in 2020, Gu said, ""Since I was little, I've always said when I'm in the U.S., I'm American, but when I'm in China, I'm Chinese."",According to Brownell, all the foreign-born athletes who are representing China at the Olympics have refused to answer questions about the status of their citizenship.,She said it is not unusual for athletes to represent countries other than their birth countries at major sports events.,An article she co-authored with Niko Besnier, professor of cultural anthropology at the University of Amsterdam, points out that in the past few years, the U.S. offered fast-tracked citizenship for some athletes who were in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.,The article notes, ""Because the program involves enlisting in the U.S. Army, athletes who were born in other countries do not have to comply with the normal five-year residency rule that is strictly upheld for all other immigrants seeking citizenship."" ,""The U.S. track and field , includes four ,who benefited from this program,"" it says.,Heidi Grappendorf, associate professor of sport management at Western Carolina University, says seeking out athletes to compete for a country other than their birth country is against the Olympics' true meaning and needs to be addressed by the IOC. ,""When countries try to poach athletes from other countries to compete for them to make themselves look better, there certainly appears to be a violation of the Olympic spirit,"" she said. , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-freestyle-medal-hope-is-american-born-skier-model-eileen-gu/6421236.html,"

,"Taiwanese Vice President William Lai will attend the inauguration of the first female president of Honduras, Xiomara Castro, on Thursday in a move to shore up the relationship between Taipei and Honduras, one of Taiwan’s few remaining diplomatic allies.,Honduras is one of only 14 countries that maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Last month, its neighboring country, Nicaragua, severed ties with Taiwan and re-established relations with Beijing, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province that someday will be reunified with the mainland. Taipei views itself as a self-governing state.,Speaking at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport before his departure, Lai said he would take medical supplies to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Honduras. According to ,, since 2006 Taiwan has loaned Honduras around $205 million and given another $27 million in donations.,During a layover in Los Angeles on Tuesday, he held an online meeting with U.S. lawmakers to discuss bilateral trade relations and the threats posed by China, according to the ,.,“Honduras is an important ally of Taiwan in Central America,” he said Tuesday. “On this trip, we will bring a variety of Taiwan-made disease prevention equipment to give to the people of Honduras, taking concrete action to demonstrate our strong support for the Taiwan-Honduras alliance and the new Honduran administration on the first day of President Castro's term.” Less than 50% of the Honduran population is fully vaccinated, according to the ,.,During her campaign, Castro, a member of the left-wing Liberty and Refoundation Party (Libre), said she would re-establish diplomatic relations with China if elected, according to the ,. After a November trip by high-level officials from the U.S. State Department, who expressed the hope that Honduras would maintain its relationship with Taiwan, Castro backtracked and signaled support for Taiwan by retweeting congratulations from its president, Tsai Ing-wen.,Gerardo Torres, Libre Party secretary of international relations, said after Castro was elected on November 28 that the incoming administration would not sever ties with Taipei. “Nobody in the party wants to enter government distancing ourselves from the United States,” he said on December 10, according to the ,.,I believe that we have a responsibility to [Taiwan] as someone with whom we have had a good relationship,” said Rodolfo Pastor, a foreign policy adviser to Castro, according to the website ,.,“But I do believe that we also have a responsibility to our own population to be realistic, to be pragmatic and to understand that mainland China today plays a determining role that we cannot let go unnoticed,” Pastor said.,Analysts told VOA Mandarin that Castro was unlikely to cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan after the U.S. intervention.,“It's not really about what we have done to consolidate the bilateral relationship with Honduras, it’s more about the U.S. factor,” Ko Yu-Chih, an associate professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei, told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview.,Chang Kuang-Chiu, an associate professor at Chihlee University of Technology in Taipei, agreed. He said that because the U.S. is the largest trade partner of Honduras, and the U.S. military maintains the Soto Cano Air Base in the Central American country, “Honduras will likely make their relations with the U.S. as a priority.”,Meanwhile, there was speculation that Lai will meet unofficially with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, who also is attending the inauguration.,A White House official on Wednesday told VOA Mandarin that “there are no plans for her [Harris] to meet with VP Lai while in Honduras.”,While there is no official diplomatic relationship between the United States and Taiwan, informal meetings between U.S. officials and Taiwan leaders on stopovers in the U.S. have become an institutionalized part of bilateral relations.,Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for China’s State Council Office on Taiwan Affairs, said on Wednesday at a daily briefing that China strongly opposed any form of official contact between Taipei and Washington.,“The DPP [Democratic Progressive Party] authorities are using the so-called 'transit trip' to seek official contact with the United States and opportunities for independence,” she said. “No matter what trick they use, it will not change the fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of China.”,Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA Mandarin that observers who follow relations between China and Taiwan are keeping an eye on whether Harris and Lai will have any meaningful interaction on the margins of the inauguration, and if so, what messages are shared.,“Traditionally, international inaugurations, funerals and multilateral events, such as APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] conferences, are the venues where senior U.S. and Taiwan officials have opportunities to be in direct, personal contact. If the U.S. has a message it would like to convey to VP Lai, this inauguration presents a unique opportunity to do so,” he told VOA Mandarin in an email.,Ko, of the National Chengchi University, argued that it’s possible the two leaders might have an opportunity to exchange a few words, but that the U.S. was unlikely to arrange a talk on the sidelines because it would anger China.,“If there is such an arrangement, it will cause a great disturbance in Sino-U.S. relations, which is also not beneficial for the stability of Taiwan,” she said. “The Biden administration is now dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic at home and Ukraine crisis abroad. Taiwan is not really a priority for the U.S. at this time.”,Hass, of Brookings, said Lai’s layovers in the U.S. follow long-standing American policy in consideration for the safety, comfort, convenience and dignity of Taiwanese officials.,“It reflects the Biden administration’s efforts to maintain a steady, principled approach to its Taiwan policy,” he said. “I do not expect the transit to deviate in any significant way from established practice.” ",https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-vice-president-in-honduras-to-shore-up-relations/6414566.html,"

,"With President Joe Biden’s broader domestic agenda stymied in the Senate, Democratic leaders in Congress have begun looking for legislative victories elsewhere, with a new focus on improving the U.S. ability to compete with China.,Democrats in the House of Representatives are attempting to come to agreement on legislation that would provide large financial subsidies to the semiconductor industry as well as generous research and development grants to support supply chain resilience, buoy domestic manufacturing operations and underwrite new scientific research.,The effort in the House follows a push in the Senate last year, which resulted in bipartisan passage of the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021. That bill proposed $52 billion in assistance to the semiconductor industry as well as nearly $200 billion more on research and development projects meant to bolster U.S. competitiveness.,The House is likely to pass its own version of the legislation, meaning the two chambers would have to come to an agreement on final language before a bill could go to the White House to be signed into law. It remains unclear whether an eventual House bill would garner any Republican support in that chamber, or whether compromise language would continue to attract the Republican support that helped the Senate’s original bill come to the floor for a vote.,But in a statement this week, the president made it clear that he would like to see the legislation on his desk.,Biden praised the “transformational investments” that the legislation would make. With the proposed legislation, he said, “We have an opportunity to show China and the rest of the world that the 21st century will be the American century – forged by the ingenuity and hard work of our innovators, workers, and businesses.”,In Congress, even among conservative lawmakers who generally shy away from government intervention in the economy, there is recognition of a need to balance the scales for U.S. companies that frequently find themselves in competition with Chinese firms that receive subsidies and other preferences from the government in Beijing.,When the Senate passed its version of the bill in June, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said, “This type of targeted investment in a critical industry was unthinkable just a couple years ago, but the need for smart industrial policy is now widely accepted.”,That comes as a surprise to many observers of U.S. policymaking.,“There is somewhat of an ambivalence, or confusion, in D.C. where, on the one hand, people want to say that China's industrial policies are both very unfair, and also very important in explaining China's competitive success,” Gerard DiPippo, a senior fellow in the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA. “But then, they also seem reluctant to actually engage in those policies because they think those policies are actually very distortionary and ineffective. So, it sort of cuts both ways.”,Despite strong economic growth in the U.S. over the past year, a persistent shortage of semiconductors has caused some sectors of the economy – the automobile industry in particular – to lag behind. Supply chain disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic have been difficult to resolve, leading many members of Congress to propose funding to “re-shore” domestic production of semiconductors.,Both the Senate bill and the version being considered by the House of Representatives would funnel $52 billion in grants and subsidies to the industry.,However, China is not a major competitor of the United States when it comes to semiconductors. While China does make some semiconductors, the largest manufacturer in the world is TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. in Taiwan.,Some American companies that do business with China are concerned about the long-term efforts of both countries to achieve economic independence from each other.,“China is upset with efforts to increase export restrictions on U.S. goods, block Chinese companies from accessing certain U.S. goods, and restrict some direct investments in China,” Doug Barry, a senior director with the U.S.-China Business Council, told VOA in an email exchange.,“They worry about incentives to relocate production of some critical goods back to the U.S. At the same time, China is working to reduce dependence on certain goods like advanced semiconductors, while slow-walking promised market access reform and opening,” Barry said.,“Our members worry that these efforts signal mutual economic decoupling that’s not in the long-term interest of either country,” he said. “Both governments need to engage in direct talks to better manage differences, adhere to WTO principles, and ensure that Phase One Agreement commitments are fully met.”,Ryan Young, a senior fellow with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told VOA that efforts by Congress to mimic China by trying to manipulate the U.S. economy are “misguided” at best, and at worst destructive.,“This falls into what I think of as the ‘But they do it, too,’ argument,” Young said. While it is indisputable that the Chinese government creates all sorts of advantages for certain sectors within its economy, he said, it doesn’t follow that the answer is for the U.S. to do the same.,Despite government support, large Chinese tech firms are burdened with substantial debt, operational inefficiencies and political meddling, he said.,Further, Young noted that the semiconductor industry, which the legislative efforts target above all else, has already taken steps to bring some of its production into U.S. territory, with chip giant Intel expanding a $50 billion complex of chip manufacturing facilities in Arizona. , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-congress-considers-bills-to-boost-competition-with-china/6416247.html,"

In its Sky Net campaign, Beijing almost never uses formal legal procedures, such as requesting extradition.,""Instead, these involuntary returns (IR) account for the vast majority of Sky Net's track record: in 2018, IR stood for some 64% of the claimed successful returns, while extradition — the appropriate judicial channel for such returns — represented but 1%,"" the report said. As used in the report, the term ""involuntary returns"" refers to people who have been forced through nontraditional means to come back to China.,And although Sky Net's official targets are businesspeople and officials suspected of economic crimes, the report said it found many cases of Beijing using extrajudicial tactics to repatriate dissidents and human rights defenders.,China's tactics are like those used by the U.S. During the 1980s, U.S. officials ""developed an alternative approach to circumvent the proper diplomatic channels"" to accomplish renditions, , at the University of North Carolina School of Law. After the 9/11 attacks, the practice transformed ""into what is now referred to as the ,,"" which has drawn ,.,Russia also ,.,China favors three tactics: threatening family in China, targeting victims outside China by using threatening agents in the target's country, and kidnapping the people it wants repatriated, according to Safeguard Defenders, whose report examined 62 cases of attempts, successful and unsuccessful, to engineer involuntary returns.,Chen Yen-Ting, an author of the report, told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview on Monday that these tactics might be carried out separately or together to pressure the targeted individual. ""In some cases, the Chinese government sends agents to the host country and at the same time puts pressure on the targeted individual's family in China,"" he said.,The report cited the case of Xie Weidong, a onetime Supreme Court judge who resigned in 2000 and ended up in Canada in 2014, the year the Huanggang Municipal Public Security Bureau charged him with accepting a bribe of 1.4 million yuan ($221,000) to settle a 1999 civil case in favor of a particular company, according to a 2019 article by Canada's ,.,Xie claimed Beijing targeted him ""when he failed to abide by government interventions in cases he heard. Then after leaving China he spoke out about problems in its legal system,"" according to an Interpol ruling ,. The ,reported that Interpol found China's request for Xie's arrest was politically motivated.,To persuade Xie to return to China voluntarily, Chinese police detained his sister and then his son, according to the Safeguard Defenders report. Chinese authorities also contacted his ex-wife and his former business partner, hoping to use them as leverage.,Li Jinjin, a New York-based lawyer who represents some targets of the Sky Net operation, told VOA Mandarin on Monday that the Chinese government often freezes the property in China of the target's family members.,In other cases, Li said, Beijing will send its police or hire agents to visit an overseas target. Using promises or threats, their goal is to force the target to return to China.,In 2020, this tactic backfired when the U.S. Justice Department charged eight people with conspiring to act as illegal agents for the Chinese government and force U.S. residents to return to Beijing. These people were ""allegedly acting at the direction and under the control of PRC (People's Republic of China) government officials, conducted surveillance of and engaged in a campaign to harass, stalk, and coerce certain residents of the United States to return to the PRC,"" ,.,Safeguard Defenders expect China will intensify its Sky Net efforts in 2022 if the Western governments fail to act against Beijing, Chen told VOA Mandarin. ""It will be a significant obstacle to legitimate judicial cooperation to counter cross-border crime,"" he said.,The Chinese government has hailed Sky Net's success. The Xinhua News Agency, a state-controlled news outlet, published on Saturday a piece saying that the operation was recovering people and stolen goods, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.,""The legal net is vast, you can escape the country, but you ,,"" Xinhua said.,Li Gang decided to talk to the media to counter reports on Beijing-controlled outlets. ""I used to be very fearful of the Chinese government's retaliation, so I refused all media interviews before,"" Li said told VOA Mandarin in 2020.,""But now I realize the more fearful I am, the more power they have on me,"" he said.

,"Taiwan has pledged $1 billion to Lithuania in its latest move to counter China’s pressure on the small Baltic nation — the first European Union member to allow Taipei to use its name on a de facto embassy.,Taiwan’s promise made Tuesday will help fund joint projects in half a dozen sectors and comes after a January 5 agreement to invest $200 million in Lithuanian industry.,The combined $1.2 billion investment aims to counter China’s increasing pressure on Vilnius since November 18, when Lithuanian authorities allowed Taiwan to open a representative office in its capital under the name “Taiwan” instead of “Taipei.”,That gesture upset China, which views Taiwan as part of its territory. In the past two months, China has recalled its ambassador from Vilnius while ordering Lithuania’s ambassador to leave Beijing, and it has implemented an embargo against Lithuania, boycotting all of its exports as well as any EU products that use Lithuanian-made components.,In a press conference Wednesday, , called the $1.2 billion investment “the Taiwan authorities’ attempts to expand space for Taiwan independence activities with dollar diplomacy.”, eventually returning to its control, even though many Taiwanese perceive themselves as a self-governing nation.,“None of us thought the trade volume between Lithuania and China was that large, so we figured China wouldn’t use economic sanctions against them,” Chang Fu-chang, an associate professor with the Graduate Institute of European Studies at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA Mandarin. “But we were wrong.”,Bor Yunchang, an economics professor at the Chinese Culture University in Taipei, is pessimistic about Taiwan’s investments. He told VOA Mandarin: “Any investment made for political gains will be on thin ice. It just can’t be as effective in connecting the two countries as capital flows among private sectors.”,In most European countries and the United States, Taiwan uses Taipei, the name of its capital, for its foreign offices that are embassies in all but their official designation. Lithuania’s move came as many governments are exploring expanded ties with Taiwan, a high-tech industry powerhouse, even as Beijing’s increasingly assertive foreign and military policy in the region has caused uneasiness worldwide.,Taiwan’s presence in Vilnius is its first new representative office in Europe since the Taipei Representative Office opened in Bratislava, Slovakia, in 2003. When the office opened, China’s Foreign Ministry accused Lithuania of “undermining Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity"" and told Vilnius to “correct the mistakes immediately.”,“This development is really striking,” Timothy Heath, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, told VOA’s Russian Service, referring to the Vilnius office. “It is the first time a European country has expressed formal recognition of Taiwan in decades. It’s a pretty big development, and understandably China is very angry at this change.”,Relations between the two countries were fraying before Taiwan’s newest office opened. In August, Beijing stopped approving new permits for Lithuanian food exports to China and halted direct freight train service to Lithuania. Then, in November, China began pressuring companies in the EU to stop using Lithuanian components.,Mantas Adomenas, Lithuania's vice minister for foreign affairs, , that China had “been sending messages to multinationals that if they use parts and supplies from Lithuania, they will no longer be allowed to sell to the Chinese market or get supplies there,"",In a , with Taiwan’s National Development Council Minister Kung Ming-Hsin on Tuesday, Aušrinė Armonaitė, Lithuania’s minister of the economy and innovation, said Vilnius was already seeing companies cancel contracts with Lithuanian providers because of pressure from Beijing.,“I think China is very worried that Lithuania is setting a precedent and more countries in Europe could follow Lithuania’s example. I think this is the reason why China has reacted so harshly,” said Heath.,Chang of Taiwan’s Tamkang University said China’s targeting of multinational companies in EU member states outside Lithuania is particularly effective because the enterprises value the lucrative Chinese market.,He said Lithuania’s biggest trading partners include two other Baltic countries — Estonia and Latvia — and Russia and the EU.,Chang added that while “Taiwan has stepped up its efforts in developing trade relations with Vilnius, Lithuania’s export structure is unlikely to change in the short term.”,There are also different opinions among Lithuania’s leaders over their nation’s trade policy with China. In early January, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it had been a “mistake” to allow use of the Taiwan designation.,Chang said external pressure and internal disputes are hampering efforts by the Lithuanian government to obtain public support for its policy on China and Taiwan. Within the government, diverging views of the president and the prime minister have triggered a confrontation between pro-China and anti-China factions, he added.,“So the big question is how long can the Lithuanian government stand by Taiwan,” Chang told VOA Mandarin. “That $1.2 billion isn’t a big amount, so, long term, it’s hard to say where the economic relationship between the two countries will be.”,Heath of the Rand Corporation said that many countries are taking a “wait and see” attitude on whether they might want to consider the path Lithuania has taken.,“I think in the near term, the EU recognizes the importance of the trade relations with China. The larger countries — France, Germany, Italy — are not in a rush to destabilize their trade relationship with China,” he told VOA Mandarin.,Heath continued: “Nevertheless, I think countries in Europe and around the world are watching closely: What happens to Lithuania? Does it back off its relationship with Taiwan? Or does it maintain it? Whatever it decides, many countries in the world will be watching carefully and thinking about what that might mean for their own relationship with Taiwan.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-even-eu-members-taking-wait-and-see-approach-on-china-lithuania-standoff-/6398009.html,"

,"Chinese technology and expertise is making it possible for Venezuela and Cuba to exercise suffocating control over digital communications in the two countries, according to insider accounts and several international investigations. ,Venezuela and Cuba do more to block internet access than any other governments in Latin America, according to the U.S.-based advocacy group Freedom House, which has documented what it describes as ""digital authoritarianism"" in the region since 2018. ,“Whoever believes that privacy exists in Venezuela through email communications, Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram is wrong. All these tools” are totally subject to government intervention, said Anthony Daquin, former adviser on computer security matters to the Ministry of Justice of Venezuela. ,Daquin participated between 2002 and 2008 in delegations sent by former President Hugo Chávez to China to learn how Beijing uses software to identify Chinese citizens, and to implement a similar system in Venezuela. ,Key to those efforts was the introduction in 2016 of the “carnet de la patria” or homeland card, developed by the Chinese company ZTE. While theoretically voluntary, possession of the cards is required to access a vast range of goods and services, ranging from doctor’s appointments to government pensions. ,The cards were presented as a way to make public services and supply chains more efficient, but critics denounced them as a form of “citizen control."" ,Daquin said China's role in recent years has been to provide technology and technical assistance to help the Venezuelan government process large amounts of data and monitor people whom the government considers enemies of the state. ,""They have television camera systems, fingerprints, facial recognition, word algorithm systems for the internet and conversations,” he said. ,Daquin said one of the few means that Venezuelans have to communicate electronically free from government monitoring is the encrypted messaging platform Signal, which the government has found it very costly to control. ,The former adviser said Venezuela’s digital surveillance structure is divided into five “rings,” with ""Ring 5 being the most trusted, 100 percent Chinese personnel supervising.” ,According to Daquin, the government receives daily reports from the monitors that become the basis for decisions on media censorship, internet shutdowns and arbitrary arrests. ,Several Chinese technology companies are active in Venezuela, including ZTE, Huawei and the China National Electronics Import & Export Corp. (CEIEC). The latter was sanctioned in 2020 by the U.S. Treasury Department on the grounds that its work in Venezuela had helped the government of President Nicolas Maduro ""restrict internet service"" and ""conduct digital surveillance and cyber operations against political opponents."",The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee also issued an alert in 2020. In a report, ,, it accused Chinese telecommunications companies of facilitating ""digital authoritarianism” around the world and cited Venezuela as a case study. ,Specifically, the committee mentions the existence of a team of ZTE employees working within the facilities of the state telecommunications company CANTV, which manages the homeland card database. ,The document cites an investigation by the Reuters news agency, which reported it was told by CANTV employees that the card system allows them to monitor a vast range of information about individuals, including ""birthdays, family information, employment and income, property owned, medical history, state benefits received, presence on social media, membership of a political party and whether a person voted."" ,""Maduro takes full advantage of Chinese hardware and services in his effort to control Venezuelan citizens,"" the report says. ,The Maduro government’s efforts to block access to the internet by domestic opponents are “very crude,"" according to Luis Carlos Díaz, president of the Venezuelan chapter of the Internet Society, a U.S.-based nonprofit that advocates for open development of the internet. ,He said it takes nothing more than a phone call from a government official to the operator of a web portal to have a website or social media outlet blocked for a time. ,However, in 2019, Venezuela blocked The Onion Router, or TOR, one of the most sophisticated systems used globally to allow internet users to remain anonymous and bypass censorship. The platform directs messages through a worldwide network of servers so the origin of a message cannot be identified. ,Diaz said that, unlike other recurrent blockades in Venezuela, the TOR hack did require a higher level of knowledge. ,""There, we raised alerts because it was excessively serious,” he told VOA. “It meant that the Venezuelan government was using technology like the one used in China to block users who had TOR, a tool used to circumvent censorship."" ,The TOR blockade lasted a week, and Díaz said he doubts that the Venezuelan government did it by itself, because it lacks the highly trained people needed for such a complex operation. ,The internet infrastructure in Cuba was also built with equipment acquired from Chinese companies. The Swedish organization Qurium, in a report published at the beginning of 2020, said it had detected Huawei eSight network management software on the Cuban internet. The purpose of the software is to help filter web searches, according to this organization. ,Cuban dissidents say the only way to access pages censored by the government on the island is through a virtual private network or VPN, which tricks the system into believing that the user is in another country. ,This ""is the only way to enter any controlled website,"" said journalist Luz Escobar, who converts web content into PDF format or newsletters and sends those by email to users of 14yMedio, an independent digital news outlet that is blocked from uploading its content to the internet. In Cuba, however, “few people master this technique,"" she said. ,Internet censorship in Cuba was investigated in 2017 by the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), a volunteer-based organization that monitors internet censorship around the world. The group said it was able to determine that a Chinese company had developed software for public Wi-Fi portals on the island ""because they left comments in the source code in Chinese.” ,""We also found a wide use of Huawei equipment,"" said Arturo Filastó, a project leader at OONI who had traveled to Cuba and tested various Wi-Fi connection points provided by the government. ,Voice of America asked for comments from the three government entities in question — Cuba, Venezuela and China — but did not receive responses from any of them before publication. ,China continues to tutor countries with an ""authoritarian tendency"" ,In a 2019 report on internet censorship, Freedom House said Venezuelan officials, along with representatives from 36 other countries including Saudi Arabia and Syria, participated in Chinese government training and seminars on new media and information management. ,China has organized forums such as the World Internet Conference in 2017 ""where it imparts its norms to authoritarian-leaning governments,"" the report concluded. ,Justin Sherman, an information security expert at the Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative, told VOA that Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE have ""been involved all over the world, not just in Venezuela, in creating programs of internet censorship surveillance for governments, intelligence services and police agencies.” ,Sherman said it is not clear whether Chinese companies sell their surveillance technology to authoritarian governments solely for profit. The thesis of the 2020 Senate Relations Committee report is that there is an interest in China to go beyond the sale of its technology services to extend its policy of ""digital authoritarianism in the world.” ",https://www.voanews.com/a/china-seen-backing-digital-authoritarianism-in-latin-america-/6398072.html,"

China denies it and wants to maintain the status quo along the border.,Ahead of the talks, both countries described the situation along the border as “stable.” But India’s army chief, M.M.

He described the situation along the India-China border as “generally stable.”,Ahead of the talks, the U.S. said it is closely monitoring the situation along the India-China border and supports “peaceful resolution of these border disputes.”,“We’ve been pretty clear how we view Beijing’s behavior in the region and around the world. We believe it can be destabilizing.

,"China is transforming Kenya and the rest of Africa through infrastructure projects and investments. Many Africans welcome the developments, while others worry about Beijing's motives and the long-term impact on their countries.,With China's Belt and Road initiative bringing temporary workers from the world's most populous country, neighborhoods such as Kilimani in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, are filled with billboards in Mandarin for Chinese-run casinos, karaoke centers and traditional Chinese medicine clinics. Such areas have not been officially dubbed ""Chinatown"" —yet.,Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is on a visit, January 4 to 7, to the East African countries of Kenya, Eritrea and Comoros. Wang's efforts to strengthen ties support the Belt and Road initiative goal of enhancing China's land and sea trade in Asia, Europe and Africa.,Africans have taken a mostly positive view of the Asian newcomers.,A recent survey conducted by ,of 34 African countries from 2019 to 2020 found that while some were concerned about being heavily indebted to China, 63% of Africans viewed China as a positive external influence on the continent. In comparison, 60% and 57% viewed as a positive influence the United States and United Nations agencies, respectively. ,China's presence can be seen throughout Nairobi. Construction projects are ubiquitous, and every neighborhood seems to be reinventing itself with apartment blocks and malls erected in months, sometimes weeks. Many Kenyans say the Chinese are largely responsible for such development. ,The Chinese presence in Kenya is a net positive, said Tyson Nuthu, who works at the rock climbing gym Climb BlueSky.,""The traffic is something we all complain about. Projects like the Nairobi Western Bypass alleviate the problem. Driving to Lukenya (Nairobi's closest outdoor crag) has been better since Mombasa Road is almost completed,"" he said in a phone interview with VOA. ""Plus, I think seeing a different work ethic is good for Kenyans. It drives up the competition a bit."",Speaking last month at the site of the Nairobi Expressway toll road, a Chinese-backed infrastructure project, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said his country's relationship with China is ""mutually beneficial — that is, based on win-win."" He said an improved infrastructure would make life easier for people and was ""key"" to Kenya's economy.,For years, however, analysts have speculated about ,, with some accusing it of ""malicious"" behavior. In 2011, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described China's actions as ""new colonialism."" ,Chinese infrastructure deals are secretive and bad for the local economy, some critics contend., ,Laura Otieno, a civil engineer on the Nairobi Western Bypass, which circumvents traffic congestion in the capital city, works mainly with Chinese firms. In an interview with VOA, she said it had taken her some time to overcome the cultural differences and language barrier when working with the Chinese.,""For the most part, we get along,"" Otieno said. ""But what I don't like is that we celebrate their holidays, such as Chinese New Year. Why should we? We're in Kenya."" ,Meanwhile, Paul Chepsoi, program director at Endorois Welfare Council, a community-based human rights organization in Nakuru, has doubts about China's intentions abroad.,""I once attended a meeting where a Chinese investor was present,"" Chepsoi said in an email interview with VOA. ""At some point, I raised my hand to ask a question on how the community will benefit from the natural resource he intended to collect from the community. He totally ignored my question."",Yuan Wang, a fellow at the Columbia-Harvard China and the World Program, said in a phone interview with VOA that ""China is relatively new to this game of facilitating cultural exchange and the overall diplomacy space."" ,She added, ""The different culture of 'doing the work' rather than 'saying the things' contributes to the perception that China lacks diplomacy."" ,In 2017, at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, President Xi Jinping described China's expansion strategies, saying, ""We will strengthen people-to-people and cultural exchanges with other countries, giving prominence to Chinese culture while also drawing on other cultures."",Xi also talked about improving the ""capacity for engaging in international communication so as to tell China's stories well; present a true, multidimensional, and panoramic view of China; and enhance our country's ,."",Beijing has embarked on this mission through a variety of initiatives that have included donating 200,000 doses of Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccines to Kenya in September 2021 and launching opportunities such as the Silk Road Global News Awards, a contest for Kenyan journalists that bestows cash prizes on winners. ,The Chinese embassy also regularly cultivates China-Kenya relations. Its website states that even as the world undergoes major transformations, the embassy ""remains committed to promoting the long-term and healthy growth of , and protecting the lawful rights and interests of overseas Chinese nationals."" ,In African countries, including Kenya, China has established Confucius Institutes, which teach Chinese language and culture in foreign universities. The institutes are largely funded by the Chinese Education Ministry.,Some students worry that the institutes are self-censoring, deliberately avoiding subjects that are politically sensitive in China. In addition, a report to the U.S. Senate found that “Confucius Institute funding comes with strings that can compromise academic freedom.” The Chinese instructors, for example, sign contracts with Beijing pledging not to damage China’s national interests., ,There is also the annual Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the training of nearly 1,000 African journalists. But some see the latter effort as ,, given China's reputation for censorship.,Mario Esteban, a senior analyst focusing on Chinese foreign policy at the Autonomous University of Madrid, said in a phone interview with VOA that China's focus on infrastructure projects has helped it burnish its reputation. Kenyans using roads or schools can see the direct benefits of a Chinese presence. ,""In terms of soft power, quite a lot of Africans believe that the Chinese are a useful partner,"" Esteban said. ,Chepsoi remains skeptical about China's intentions toward his country. ,""Most developed countries have been using this soft power approach for a long time ––that's why their economies have doubled at the expense of developing countries,"" he said.,The Chinese embassy in Nairobi did not respond to multiple requests for comments for this story.",https://www.voanews.com/a/africans-reactions-mixed-to-chinese-presence-on-continent/6383863.html,"

,"Gazprom, Russia’s giant state-owned energy company, is slated to finalize an agreement in 2022 for a second huge natural gas pipeline running from Siberia to China, marking yet another stage in what energy analysts and Western diplomats say is a fast-evolving gas pivot to Asia by Moscow.,They see the pivot as a geopolitical project and one that could mean trouble for Europe.,Known as Power of Siberia 2, the mega-pipeline traversing Mongolia will be able to deliver 50 billion cubic meters of Russian gas to China annually. It was given the go-ahead in March by Russian President Vladimir Putin, and when finished it will complement another massive pipeline, Power of Siberia 1, that transports gas from Russia’s Chayandinskoye field to northern China.,Power of Siberia 2 will supply gas from Siberia’s Yamal Peninsula, the source of the gas exported to Europe. Western officials worry that the project could have serious geopolitical implications for energy-hungry European nations before they embark in earnest on a long transition to renewables and away from fossil fuels.,For months Western leaders and officials have been accusing Russia of worsening an energy crunch that’s hit Europe this year and threatens to deepen during the northern hemisphere winter. Gazprom has shrugged off urgent European requests for more natural gas. In the past few weeks Gazprom has at times even reduced exports, say industry monitors.,The energy giant maintains it has been meeting the volumes of gas it agreed to in contracts, but Gazprom has been accused by the International Energy Agency and European lawmakers of deliberately not doing enough to boost supplies to Europe as the continent struggles with unprecedented price hikes and the increasing risk of power rationing and plant stoppages.,The new Sino-Russian energy project, which Putin discussed with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, during a December 18 video conference, will give Moscow even more leverage when price bargaining with Europe and boost China as an alternative market for gas, according to Filip Medunic, an analyst with the European Council on Foreign Relations.,“Russia remains Europe’s main gas supplier, but Europeans urgently need to understand the changes it is currently making to its energy transport infrastructure—as these changes could leave Europe even more at Moscow’s mercy,” he outlined in a study earlier this year.,Speaking after his conference call with Xi Jinping, the Russian president told reporters that the pipeline's route, length and other parameters have been agreed to, and a feasibility study will be completed in the next several weeks.,The Kremlin has been eager to expand its energy market in China, which will need more gas in coming years to substitute for an eventual phasing down of coal, according to Vita Spivak, an energy analyst at Control Risks, a global consulting firm. Spivak told a discussion forum earlier this month that Kremlin officials are anxious to “exploit the opportunity” especially “considering there is a good working relationship between the two capitals.”,The Power of Siberia 2 pipeline has been championed by Putin, she said.,McKinsey, the strategic management consulting firm, estimates Chinese demand for gas will double by 2035. That will be a godsend for Russia. European governments are already setting out plans on how to transform their energy markets—how they will generate, import and distribute energy and shift to renewables and, in some cases, nuclear power. Russia needs to diversify into Asia to prolong its profits from its vast natural gas resources as Europe slowly weans itself off Gazprom supplies.,But Europe will remain dependent on Russian gas in the near future and Moscow has been busy re-ordering its complex network of pipelines, shaping them for wider economic and political purposes, say energy and national security analysts. Currently it supplies Europe through several pipelines—Nord Stream I, TurkStream and another from Yamal that terminates in Germany after transiting Belarus and Poland.,And it has just completed the controversial Nord Stream 2 underwater pipeline, which connects Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, circumventing older land routes through Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 has yet to receive final approval by German authorities.,Washington has long warned of the risk of Nord Stream 2 making the EU in the short term even more dependent for its energy needs on Russia and potentially vulnerable to economic coercion by the Kremlin. The planned Power of Siberia 2 pipeline will be able to pump into China around the same amount that Nord Stream 2 would be able to transport to Europe, giving the Kremlin more options about who gets the gas and at what price.,A senior European diplomat told VOA that Gazprom’s refusal to come up with additional supplies during the current energy crunch already “demonstrates Russia’s questionable motives about how ready it is to use the energy market for purely political purposes.” He added, “As it diversifies to China, it will give the Kremlin more opportunities to turn off and on supplies to Europe but reduce considerably any financial risks for Russia.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-gas-pivot-to-china-poses-challenge-for-europe/6375859.html,"

,"Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, nations are looking for ways to coexist with the COVID-19 pathogen without shutting down their economies again with lockdowns The United States reopened its borders in November. Britain has eased testing and quarantine requirements for vaccinated arrivals.,Even countries that once had strict COVID-19 control measures, such as Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, have all dropped their goal of zero cases. Instead, most countries are trying to prevent their health care systems from becoming stretched to the breaking point while allowing their citizens to live semi-normal lifestyles.,But there’s an outlier: China.,China is the last country still holding onto a strict zero tolerance policy. Over the past two years, Chinese authorities say they have contained more than 30 COVID-19 outbreaks, including ones caused by the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. Strict health care measures help keep the infection at bay, including mass testing, snap lockdowns and extensive quarantines.,A recent outbreak in China’s Zhejiang province, a major industrial and export hub on the country’s east coast, left more than half a million people in quarantine, hundreds of factories shut down, and most flights out of provincial capital Hangzhou canceled. In November, Shanghai closed Disneyland, banning anyone inside from leaving while officials performed more than 100,000 COVID-19 tests after a single positive case.,And China has locked down Yuzhou and Xian. Yuzhou’s 1.1 million people were ordered this week to remain indoors, and Xian, with 13 million people, has been under the same restrictions for about two weeks. ,With the emergence of more contagious varieties, such as the delta and the new omicron strain of the coronavirus, Beijing seems to be doubling down its effort to contain any sporadic outbreaks.,“You have to give China a lot of credit for keeping COVID so low for two years, but now I think we have passed the point where we can expect to prevent cases because it’s simply so transmissible, and eventually China is going to have to open up to the world,” Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Washington’s Georgetown University and the director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, told VOA. ,Experts pointed out that rigid disease control measures will be unsustainable to maintain as more contiguous variants appear across the globe.,The new omicron variant has been detected in at least 89 countries,since it was first discovered in South Africain November. Health officials say the strain may be much more transmissible than delta and more resistant to COVID-19 vaccines. ,“In fact, the omicron variant might be one of the most infectious pathogens on the planet. So, I don't think it's sustainable for China to expect to have zero tolerance for cases because it's only a matter of time before China is overwhelmed with cases,” Gostin told VOA.,A recent study by a , found the omicron variant multiplies 70 times faster in the human bronchial tubes than the delta variant, leading to faster transmission among humans than previous versions. ,Delta is already believed to be more than twice as contagious as previous variants, according to the , ,Chen Xi, an associate professor of health policy and economics at the Yale School of Public Health, pointed out that China has shifted from a zero-tolerance policy to a “dynamic” zero tolerance policy, meaning that the country acknowledges it is impossible to keep the case number to zero.,Yet according to Chen, Beijing is unlikely to relax its strict COVID-19 policies anytime soon.,“China’s approach now is ‘wait and see.’ There are two major events in China in 2022: the Winter Olympics and the 20th National Congress. So, China does not want to make a move right now that might cause any disruption in its society,” Chen told VOA. ,Analysts believe Chinese President Xi Jinping will secure a third five-year term at the 20th National Party Congress scheduled for the final months of 2022.,One reason for China’s extreme caution on COVID-19 transmissions is the number of hospital beds in the country. According to data from ,, China has 3.6 ICU beds per 100,00 patients. Meanwhile, that number for the U.S. is 34.7 and 29.2 for Germany. ,“China’s medical capacity is insufficient if there’s a large outbreak. For example, the number of nurses per 1,000 people in China is about one-seventh that of the U.S., and the United States is already in short supply of nurses,” Chen added. ,Government data released last week showed retail sales struggled and investment continued to weaken, suggesting that more frequent outbreaks and lockdowns are taking their toll on the economy.,For example, the recent lockdown in Zhejiang Province, a major manufacturing hub that accounts for 6% of China’s total economy, is “triggering local restrictions and factory shutdowns… further supply chain disruption is a significant possibility,” analysts from London-based Capital Economics wrote in a research note last week, according to CNN.,Chen from the Yale School of Public Health pointed out that apart from economic costs, there are costs related to China’s communication with other parties of the world.,“We see that many pandemics eventually lead to wars, and that’s because these pandemics hinder communication,” he said. “I think the zero-tolerance policy has a negative effect on Sino-U.S. and Sino-EU relations particularly.” ,“It’s not just China,” said Huang Yanzhong, a senior Fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. “The pandemic is limiting the movement of people; it also limits the effective communication and exchange of ideas.”,Huang added, “And that is contributing to all this disinformation, misinformation and conspiracy theories.”,
,
Other experts argued that China’s zero tolerance policy might give the country a geopolitical advantage for the long term. Raina MacIntyre is a professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney and a principal research Fellow at Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council. She leads a research program on the prevention and control of infectious diseases.,“The virus attacks the heart, the lungs and even causes neurocognitive damage. We have not even begun to appreciate the population level burden of chronic disease, cognitive impairment and organ damage that countries with a large burden of disease will be living with,” MacIntyre told VOA.,She said if China keeps the infection largely under control, its population will be fit and healthy into the future, “while the U.S. and Europe will be groaning under an unprecedented burden of chronic disease and even generational burden from potential long-term effects on children,” she added.,While China’s strategy at the moment is to suppress transmission as long as there remains significant transmission globally, experts pointed out some of the costs will accumulate and create a different set of incentives for the country.,“Unfortunately, most experts expect widespread transmission of COVID-19 into 2023, and there are plenty of plausible scenarios in which it could last further. Most experts also expect COVID-19 to eventually become endemic,” Thomas Hale, a professor of global public health policy at the University of Oxford, told VOA.,He said that all governments, China included, will need to develop plans for how to manage this disease on an ongoing basis.,“For an endemic disease, it is very difficult to define success as near zero transmission,” he continued, adding that a better metric will be the overall health impact of the disease. He said governments will rely on a mix of vaccines, treatments, increased health care capacity, and containment measures to keep the health impact low.",https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-zero-covid-strategy-braces-for-omicron/6365164.html,"

,"The U.S. Congress moved the United States one step closer this week to becoming the first country to ban the import of goods produced by Uyghur slave labor.,After more than a year of negotiations, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act passed the U.S. Senate unanimously Thursday, clearing the way for President Joe Biden to sign the bill into law.,Once it becomes law, the bill will ban all imports from China’s Xinjiang region into the United States unless companies can show the U.S. government “clear and convincing evidence” their supply chains have not used the labor of ethnic Muslims enslaved in Chinese camps.,Beijing describes the camps as ""re-education"" facilities aimed at combating terrorism.,Democratic Representative Jim McGovern and Republican Senator Marco Rubio reached a compromise agreement on bills they had each passed in their respective chambers over the past year. The White House said Tuesday it would work closely with Congress to implement the measure.,“We agree with Congress that action can and must be taken to hold the People’s Republic of China accountable for genocide and human rights abuses and to address forced labor in Xinjiang,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement ahead of House passage of the bill.,The renewed push to hold China accountable for rights abuses comes ahead of the February 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The U.S. declared Chinese treatment of the Uyghurs genocide earlier this year and announced a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics last week. Earlier this month, an independent tribunal found Chinese senior leadership holds “primary responsibility” for acts of genocide against the Uyghurs.,China condemned House passage of the bill early Wednesday, describing the U.S. as hypocritical for not addressing forced labor within its own borders. ,“China firmly opposes the interference by the U.S. Congress in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of Xinjiang-related issues. By cooking up lies and making troubles on such issues, some U.S. politicians are seeking to contain China and hold back China’s development through political manipulation and economic bullying in the name of human rights,” China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said in a press conference Wednesday.,Human rights groups praised the legislation and said it marked an important starting point for countries to address Chinese treatment of the Uyghurs. ,“It's a signal to the rest of the world that the U.S. is actually going to take action on this,” Peter Irwin, senior program officer for advocacy and communications at the Uyghur Human Rights Project, told VOA.,“It can also set a template for other governments to pick this up and say we're going to pass our own forced labor bill. For example, if the U.S. stops allowing in forced labor goods, then [Chinese] leaders shift their exports to Europe or to Canada. So having that template for other governments to pick up and actually pass these kinds of bills, that helps the U.S. — similar to the diplomatic boycott. The U.S. was first; other governments followed.”,The original 2020 Senate version of the bill, co-sponsored by Rubio and Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, marked the first time a bill addressing Uyghur human rights was passed anywhere in the world.,U.S. companies Nike and Coca-Cola actively lobbied against earlier versions of the legislation. The Biden administration did come out in support of those versions, leading Rubio to claim the White House was holding back on his bill due to concerns from climate change envoy John Kerry. Irwin told VOA more than 40% of the world’s polysilicon supply comes from Xinjiang, a loss that would complicate the manufacture of solar cells and panels.,Rubio praised the compromise legislation in a statement Tuesday, saying, “The United States is so reliant on China that we have turned a blind eye to the slave labor that makes our clothes, our solar panels, and much more. That changes today. Our Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act will require businesses importing goods into the United States to prove that their supply chains are not tainted with slave labor. It is time to end our economic addiction to China.” ,The legislation marks a rare point of bipartisan agreement on Capitol Hill.,Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also praised the legislation, saying it marked an opportunity for the U.S. Congress to “continue to condemn and confront the CCP’s human rights abuses in Xinjiang and in the region and hold it accountable. If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights any place in the world,” Pelosi said in a statement ahead of the vote.",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-poised-to-become-first-country-to-ban-goods-made-by-uyghur-slave-labor-/6356094.html,"

,"China accounts for a relatively small share of outside investment in the western Balkans compared to the European Union, but observers say there is growing concern about the scope of Chinese influence tied to the billions of dollars Beijing has invested in the region since 2005. ,Others, however, say China's regional influence is overblown. ,The financial estimates vary. The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies says China on average has invested roughly $1 billion in the region annually since 2011, while The American Enterprise Institute estimates roughly the same amount annually since 2005. The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies put the figure at closer to $1.8 annually since 2012. ,Experts agree, however, that about 80% of Chinese western Balkan investment, including projects in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, and North Macedonia, goes to Serbia. ,While China accounts for an estimated 1% of annual foreign investment in Serbia, ,, a , showed that 71% of Serbians identified China among the region's important economic partners.,At a recent Belgrade conference on Chinese influence in the region, some experts said public opinion favoring Beijing's investments over those from Western Europe are skewed by a politicized narrative. ,""A good part of the pro-Chinese narrative comes from the Serbian political elites and the media, which are under the direct or indirect control of the Serbian elite,"" said Vuk Vuksanović, an expert on China, the EU and the western Balkans at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy. ""So, in that respect, China did not have an excessive campaign to shape its image in Serbia, for the simple reason that it did not have to. China has the Serbian government [do] all that for her, and, realistically, the perception of China is positive in Serbian public opinion."" ,Stefan Vladisavljev of the Belgrade Fund for Political Excellence said some regional lawmakers and officials prefer Chinese investments because Beijing requires fewer obligations from regional officials and actors on the ground. ,""When [China] approaches countries — these are usually developing countries — [China] offers infrastructure projects that are often agreed [upon in] some non-transparent [way] … they come without many conditions, and that is attractive,"" said Vladisavljev, referring to , that require regional governments and businesses to prove they're in compliance with EU standards. ,""If someone does not politically pressure you … to undergo certain reforms, [to show] respect for competition or rule of law, you will be very happy to implement such projects,"" Vladisavljev said. ,Officials at the Chinese embassy in Belgrade did not respond to multiple requests for comment. ,In 20 years, Vladisavljev added, Serbia is projected to hold more than $7.9 billion in Chinese loans. Before accruing any additional debt from Beijing, he said, Serbia should ensure safeguards are in place for Serbian laborers, pointing to allegations of exploitative labor practices at China's Shandong Linglong Tire Co. in Zrenjanin — less than an hour's drive from Belgrade — where Vietnamese migrant workers have gone unpaid, living in unheated barracks.,""Now we are talking about the workers' rights of the Vietnamese, and tomorrow maybe our own Serbian workers,"" Vladisavljev said. ,Linglong did not respond to multiple requests for commentary on accusations of poor labor practices, nor did officials at the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. ,Serb leaders such as Prime Minister Ana Brnabic have played down the tire factory exposé, claiming the bad press coverage was organized ""by those against Chinese investments"" in Serbia, alluding to frequent criticism from the West that Chinese projects there are bureaucratically opaque, ecologically questionable and designed to bolster Beijing's political influence in Europe. ,""At the beginning, ,. Now … they focus on workers there. After tomorrow there will be something else,"" she said in news reports. ,Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said a Serbian labor inspector has been sent to the Zrenjanin site but was blunt about expected findings. ,""What do they want? Do they want us to destroy a $900 million investment?"" Vucic asked, largely echoing advocates for Chinese investment who say it stabilizes the region through job creation. ,Until recently, the Western response to Chinese influence in the region was minimal. EU officials only recently branded investments in the western Balkans, such as the ,, as a key part of the West's response to China's Belt and Road Initiative. ,But Igor Novakovic of the Belgrade-based International and Security Affairs Centre said EU funding is often more difficult to secure than Chinese investments. ,""With [long-established Serbian-Chinese] cooperation, money was quickly obtained and the work was carried out quickly, but the question of the price and the negative aspect for the environment remain,"" he told VOA. ""Cooperation with the EU is slow, but thorough."" ,Economic consultant Jens Bastian said China often seizes on public infrastructure projects rejected or unrealized by EU players. ,""China is [compelled] to come to southeast Europe and invest because others have not done so,"" Bastian told VOA. ""Beijing is strategically determined to stay in the region for a long time."" ,Montenegrin financial consultant Miloš Vuković said the havoc wrought on , caused by a Belt-and-Road loan — a $1 billion highway project that went to bid without tender and pushed the national debt higher than GDP — should serve as a stark warning to neighboring countries vulnerable to ,.,If Montenegro defaults, Vuković said, public assets such as the nation's electrical grid or industrial ports could become collateral for Chinese debts. ,""Later, if we can't pay ... they can say, 'We will take the state electricity [and] invest in renewable energy sources,'"" he told VOA. ""So, they replace the unprofitable project for them with a profitable project — and we know that energy is the future, especially renewables."" ,University of Belgrade economist Ivan Vujacic, Serbia's ambassador to the U.S. from 2002 to 2009, said regional corruption, specifically local political elites who deliberately misrepresent Chinese loans as investments, is partially to blame for China-funded projects that put state assets, workers' rights or the environment at risk. ,""I assume that for the investments [that China has] calculated, it pays off for them and … they are on the way to achieving a [profitable] result,"" said Vujacic, referring to , in Bor. ,""As for Serbia, I assume and I hope that the feasibility studies have been done properly and that they will give results,"" he said. ""But we do not have a guarantee for that."",

,"Top U.S. defense officials admit recent Chinese military advancements, including the test of a hypersonic weapon system, are reason to worry, but the secretary of defense says if Beijing was hoping to intimidate or scare the U.S., that is not happening.,“America isn’t a country that fears competition,” Lloyd Austin told government officials and defense companies in a speech Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California.,“We’re facing a formidable challenge,” he said. “And we’re going to meet this one with confidence and resolve — not panic and pessimism.”,During his speech, Austin addressed China and Taiwan, but he also spoke about Russia, which has tens of thousands of troops massed along its border with Ukraine.,The U.S. remains focused on Ukraine, he said, adding that Russia had invaded before, in 2014 when it annexed the Crimean Peninsula. The U.S. is making sure Ukraine has what it needs to defend its territory, Austin said.,On Taiwan, Austin said the U.S. is working to deter conflict, not change the status quo. He said the U.S. is seeking open lines of communication with China’s military leaders to prevent miscalculations. ,Top U.S. military officials have repeatedly raised concerns for months, warning Beijing is “closing the gap” as it aims to surpass the United States as the world’s preeminent military power in the coming decade.,Washington’s most senior military officer, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went as far as to compare China’s hypersonic test in July to Russia’s launch of the world’s first artificial satellite in the 1950s, which sparked the space race that dominated the next several decades.,“I don’t know if it’s quite a Sputnik moment, but I think it’s very close to that,” Milley told Bloomberg Television last month. “It has all of our attention.”,A Pentagon report released last month on China’s military power concluded that Beijing is “increasingly willing to confront the United States and other countries in areas where interest diverge,” and warned that China is likely to have at least 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030.,Only Defense Secretary Austin, just back from a trip to Seoul where he met with his South Korean counterpart, has been seeking to lessen the anxiety that has been growing in Washington and elsewhere.,During a joint news conference with South Korean Defense Minister Suh Wook this past Wednesday, Austin called China’s hypersonic test “a capability but certainly not the only capability.”,“We have concerns,” he said, adding, “My job is to focus on the broader picture.”,In prepared remarks Saturday, Austin says the U.S. “has been stepping up its efforts” to counter China’s rise as a military power, looking to pour more money into research and development, and testing, of new systems that will allow the U.S. to be more lethal from afar.,He also says money is being spent on drone and stealth technologies, and efforts are being made to make sure existing weapons systems are more resilient, both the physical attack and attacks from cyberspace.,“When we maintain our technological edge, we maintain our military edge,” according to Austin’s prepared remarks. “The United States has an advantage that no autocracy can match—our combination of free enterprise, free minds, and free people.”,The Defense Department, under Austin, has also been emphasizing stronger ties with allies in the Indo-Pacific, something he emphasized during his visit to Seoul and in a subsequent phone call with his Japanese counterpart.,But he says the expansion of traditional alliances, and new efforts such as AUKUS (Australia, the U.K. and U.S.) and the Quad (the U.S., Japan, India and Australia), should not be seen as the first moves in a new Cold War, this time pitting Washington against Beijing instead of Moscow.,“We’re not seeking an Asian version of NATO or trying to build an anti-China coalition,” Austin said. “And we’re not asking countries to choose between the United States and China.”,“Instead, we’re working to advance an international system that is free, stable and open,” he added.,But some of the talks surrounding the strengthened U.S. alliances has rankled Beijing.,
Earlier this week, former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a Taiwan-based research organization that a potential Chinese military attack on Taiwan would be “a major danger to Japan's territory… and therefore an emergency for the Japan-U.S. alliance.”,In response, China summoned Japan’s ambassador for an emergency meeting.,A statement from Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Hua Chunying further criticized Abe’s remarks, saying they ""openly challenged China's sovereignty and gave brazen support to Taiwan independence forces.""",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-not-panicking-over-china-s-newfound-military-might/6339622.html,"

,"Naval forces from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan have concluded a 10-day military drill in the Philippine Sea off the southern coast of Japan, with analysts saying the threat posed by China in the Indo-Pacific region has increased the importance of the military exercises. ,The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ran the naval exercise as it has since the 1990s. Known as ANNUALEX 2021, the drill ran from November 21 to 30. According to a statement by the U.S. Navy, the five participating nations engaged in events to “enhance maritime communication skills, anti-submarine warfare operations, air warfare operations, replenishments-at-sea, cross-deck flight operations and maritime interdiction maneuvers.” ,A month earlier, aircraft carriers from the U.S. as well as a Japanese ship that accommodates helicopter landings participated in an exercise in the same region, according to the ,. ,Grant Newsham, a retired U.S. Marine colonel and a senior researcher at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies, told VOA Mandarin that in recent years, due to the threats posed by China, the military exercise has doubled in realism. ,“A total of 34 warships from the five countries conducted a 10-day exercise, demonstrating the importance of this exercise,” Newsham told VOA in a phone interview. , ,He added that while it is routine for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force to conduct exercises, “it’s the broader context in which the exercise is happening that adds a certain urgency” as “China’s People’s Liberation Army is increasingly aggressive and spewing threats throughout the region.” ,Wang Tsun-yen, a research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan, echoed Newsham’s thoughts about China’s stance. ,""If we think back to the operations of Chinese and Russian warships around Japan this year, those operations that almost circled Japan's territory are very provocative for Japan, so now countries outside the Indo-Pacific region have come to support Japan,” Wang told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview. ,“The expansion of joint military exercises is sufficient to let China and Russia know that Japan is not alone, and it is not only the U.S. military that supports Japan,"" Wang said.,In September, Japan’s defense ministry said what were believed to be a Chinese submarine and a Chinese destroyer were spotted near Amami Oshima island, according to Reuters., ,Earlier this year, China accused the U.S. fleet operating in the South China Sea of increasing regional security risks, “misunderstandings, misjudgments, and accidents at sea.” ,Washington does not recognize Beijing’s claim to virtually all of the South China Sea, an area of strategic competition between the two nations. ,According to a November 22 report by China’s state-backed news outlet ,, China’s Ministry of National Defense spokesperson Tan Kefei said that “individual countries have been vocal in support of freedom and openness, but in fact they have formed gangs to exert pressure on other countries.” He called this a Cold War mentality contrary to promoting cooperation in the region.,Newsham said the choice of the location for the joint exercise is related to a November 18 incident in which Chinese coast guard vessels shot water cannons at two Philippine boats resupplying Philippine troops at a disputed South China Sea shoal, according to the Associated Press. ,China claims more than 95% of the South China Sea region.,It has continued to engage in island building campaigns – some 1,300 hectares of tiny islets have been landfilled to sustain military infrastructure including runways long enough to accommodate bombers.,Newsham added the frequency and intensity of military exercises of the Japan Self-Defense Force has grown to reflect China’s increased presence in the area. ,“You'll note that Japan is exercising with three countries besides the United States in what is effectively a 'warfighting' exercise. Not so many years ago this would have been politically impossible owing to Japan's self-imposed legal restraints and fears of being seen as engaging in 'collective self-defense' – supposedly prohibited by Japan's constitution,” he said. ,“Nowadays, however, a multinational exercise like ANNUALEX provokes no public or political push-back. China has indeed shifted Japanese thinking towards defense,” Newsham added. ,Just five days before ANNUALEX 2021 began, Japan and the U.S. conducted their first anti-submarine warfare exercise in the South China Sea, according to the Japanese Navy. ,Newsham said that there will likely be more joint military exercises in the region. ,“Exercising in the South China Sea with the Americans is at least in part a message to China that the Americans and Japanese won't be intimidated,” he continued, pointing out that not so long ago the Japanese would have avoided exercises with the Americans in the South China Sea for fear of upsetting the Chinese. ,“Japan now seems willing to take that risk,” Newsham added. , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-say-china-s-stance-in-indo-pacific-added-realism-to-5-nation-naval-drill-/6334561.html,"

,"Chinese and Lao officials Friday will inaugurate a $5.9 billion high-speed rail line through Laos, six years after breaking ground on the first leg of Beijing’s grand plans to link China’s underdeveloped interior with the bustling seaports of Singapore by train.,The 414-kilometer ribbon of steel and concrete ties Laos’ northern border with China’s Yunnan province to its frontier with Thailand at Vientiane, Laos’ capital, across 167 bridges and 75 tunnels. With a top speed of 160 kilometers per hour, sleek new bullet trains will cut a bone-jarring 15-hour road trip down to under four hours, promising a new tide of trade and tourists from China for one of Southeast Asia’s poorest countries.,For Beijing, it is the critical opening move of a key Belt and Road Initiative project aimed at not only developing Yunnan by plugging it into some of Southeast Asia’s biggest economies but at pulling the region further into China’s orbit, analysts say.,“From a Chinese perspective it enables China to look at continental Southeast Asia as part of the hinterland, and they’ll have better control, they’ll have better access because the train is there,” said Ruth Banomyon, a professor at Thailand’s Thammasat University who studies international trade, transport and logistics.,Laos is hoping the line will help transform the country from landlocked to land-linked, drawing more foreign holidaymakers and investors in while sending more of its own wares out.,“Trade between China and Laos is not a big volume and Laos being a landlocked country needs more points to be connected to the outside world, so potentially this could help Laos develop its economy in the … long run,” said Li Mingjiang, an associate professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.,Small farmers and producers, though, will only reap the benefits if Laos commits to building the roads they will need to connect with the new trains, Li added, “otherwise … the railway will only be a transit line” that passes them by.,Pon Souvannaseng, an assistant professor of global studies at Bentley University in the United States, said railway projects driven by foreign interests have a history of doing more harm than good for countries like Laos, saddling the hosts with the costs while siphoning out the profits.,She said China, in particular, sees its BRI corridors as opportunities first and foremost to export its own labor, goods, credit and capital, taking little care to develop supply chains with the potential to spur more and better jobs in host countries.,“Essentially, you’re opening up an undeveloped market … that is surrounded by two huge world manufacturing hubs, Thailand and China. So, Laos is not the beneficiary but they’re literally footing the bill,” she said of the new line.,Laos has committed to covering 30% of the project’s $5.9 billion price tag, much of it with loans from China backed up with land and natural resources as collateral. Combined with what it has borrowed from China for other projects, Laos has triggered fears of a looming debt default and warnings that Beijing is gaining too much sway over the country.,“The railway project and other Chinese investments in Laos are creating a situation in which Laos [is] increasingly more dependent on China economically, and that will to some extent translate into China’s political and economic influence over Laos, that’s for sure,” said Li.,Pon said the completion of the high-speed railway through Laos was proof that the country was firmly in Beijing’s orbit already, having overcome both political opposition in Laos and doubts about its commercial viability in China over the past decade.,“It was an unlikely project,” she said. “So, for it to exist now, and for all the positive, flowery language to come out from the Lao side, it speaks to the geopolitical completion of that relationship.”,With the railway’s leg through Laos now complete, Beijing can focus its attention on seeing the rest of the line through.,“Going through Laos is just the first step because Laos in itself doesn’t have much to offer [China] apart from some agricultural produce and probably some mining goods such as copper,” said Ruth. “To really benefit from it is to be able to get access into Thailand [and] to link with Malaysia so that they have access to the whole of continental Southeast Asia.”,Work on isolated sections of the line is already underway in Thailand and Malaysia, though both countries are proving tougher bargaining partners for China than Laos.,Malaysia froze construction on the line in 2018 over cost concerns and only started up work again the following year after convincing China to slash the original $20 billion price tag by about a third. In Thailand, after more than 30 rounds of negotiations over several years, the government has thus far approved construction on less than a third of the line due to run from the country’s border with Laos to the capital, Bangkok. ,Ruth said Thailand was keen on the project but, unlike Laos, has the bargaining power to insist on better terms with Beijing so as to avoid the debt trap risks roiling some of China’s other BRI partners.,He believes, though, that China’s high-speed railway push through Southeast Asia will continue. ,“The juggernaut has already started moving,” he said, “so it will not stop.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/china-launches-high-speed-rail-through-laos-in-first-leg-of-southeast-asia-corridor/6336517.html,"

,"Experts say China is ramping up its push for unification with Taiwan by promoting the potential economic benefits, advantages most Taiwanese are unwilling to accept in exchange for their democracy.,China's campaign began when the Beijing-backed newspaper ,published an ,titled ""Taiwan's Future Lies in Reunification,"" which contended that reuniting with mainland China would benefit average Taiwanese citizens financially.,Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province that someday will be reunified with the mainland. Since 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party took control of China, Taiwan has considered itself a self-governing sovereign state.,The article said reunification would save military and ""money diplomacy"" expenses amounting to an extra $722 per year for each Taiwanese citizen. Annual , is close to $28,900 in 2021, compared with $11,890 ,.,Published on November 20, the article took off as other news outlets reposted it. Some Chinese netizens lauded Beijing's generosity: ""Where can you find such great government and policies? Taiwan should come back to the motherland immediately."" Some skeptics, however, wondered where the proposed benefits for Taiwan would come from: ""Are they going to get an increase in income from our [mainland citizens] tax revenue?"",In Taiwan's largest online discussion forum, ,, one of negative commenter wrote, ""Look at how the Chinese Communist Party promised Hong Kong, and look at Hong Kong now!"" And another wrote, ""No freedom to speak freely and no freedom to criticize Xi Jinping? No thank you!"",, a researcher at the Institute of International Relations at National Chengchi University in Taiwan, told VOA Mandarin he believed most Taiwanese would not forgo their democracy for cash.,""I don't think the proposal touches Taiwanese at all. When hearing this, most people feel it's a ridiculous idea,"" he said in a phone interview. ""The offer from China reflects the Communist Party's materialist view. They don't understand how much Taiwanese people value their freedom, human rights and their sense of spiritual happiness."",Beijing's propaganda effort is playing out against a flurry of incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone, the most recent on ,.,China's campaign even includes a song, ""Go to Taiwan in 2035,"" appearing on many social media platforms. The song extols the allure of Taiwan with lyrics such as ""Let's take a high-speed train to Taiwan/ The dream will be realized in 2035/ We will enjoy the scene at Penghu Bay together/ And visit Ali Mountain and Riyuetan Lake."",But the idea of reunification has been losing popularity for years, according to Michael You, chairman of the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation. He told VOA Mandarin that in 1991, 45.3% of people supported cross-strait reunification, 25.3% wanted to maintain the status quo and 12.5% preferred Taiwan independence.,""And we found that the percentage of people who support unification keeps going down since the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis,"" You said. ""In our survey this year, only 11.1% of people want to see the two sides reunified. It's a clear downward trend."",Ni Yongjie, deputy director of the Shanghai Institute of Taiwan Studies, told VOA Mandarin via phone that reunification would result in a benefit greater than $722 (20,000 New Taiwan dollars) per year per person. He said personnel exchanges and cooperation in science and technology would produce economic benefits for Taiwan and improve living standards.,""But we can't only view this from a materialism perspective,"" he said. ""China doesn't want to 'buy' Taiwan. I think we are looking for the highest level of integrated development — in our systems, lifestyles and values between people on both sides."",Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a news conference on November 24 that China was planning to develop the ""Taiwan Channel"" — a high-speed railway covering the 120 kilometers between China's Fujian province and Taiwan's Kinmen County and Matsu Islands — to facilitate tourism and trade across the Taiwan Strait.",https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwanese-rejecting-china-s-attempts-woo-them-into-reunification/6337742.html,"

,"A 17-month-old standoff between India and China in the Himalayan border region of Ladakh is imperiling the six-century-old Pashmina wool industry, which employs almost three-quarters of a million people, according to industry leaders. ,Soldiers from the two countries stood eye to eye in the disputed region for more than a year after a June 2020 clash in the Galwan valley of eastern Ladakh that left 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead, according to reports, and tensions remain high. ,The dispute has cut off almost all access to pastureland around the area where Ladakhi nomads have long herded an estimated 250,000 Pashmina-producing Changthangi goats at altitudes above 4,200 meters. ,The Indian army “is not allowing the shepherds to go to the high altitudes for the grazing and hence it has affected the production of the wool,” said Zakir Hussain Zaidi, a businessman based in Leh, the largest town in the union territory of Ladakh, who procures the wool directly from nomads.,Pashmina wool, the finest version of cashmere, is six times thinner than human hair and highly prized in the international market. While most of the world’s cashmere comes from Mongolia, an authenticated hand-embroidered Kashmiri Pashmina scarf can sell for several thousand dollars in the United States and Europe. ,Pashmina exporter Abdul Hamid Punjabi, a former president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told VOA the border friction is just the latest problem to beset Pashmina fiber production. ,Other factors include lockdowns due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and India’s abrupt move in 2019 to abrogate Article 370, which provided a degree of autonomy to the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir where much of the wool is processed. The move was accompanied by a massive security clampdown and prolonged curfew.,Both the lockdowns and the curfew have severely impacted all aspects of the Kashmiri economy, including the Pashmina sector, according to Sheikh Ashiq, president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry.,Sluggish global demand and poor quality control by some traders have also contributed to a decline in Pashmina sales, said Mahmood Ahmad Shah, director of Handicrafts and Handloom Kashmir. He told VOA that exports of the prized shawls have declined from $41 million in 2018-19 to just $23.16 million in 2020-21. ,Mujtaba Kadri, founding director of the luxury international cashmere brand ,, blames the industry’s decline in part on the low wages offered by manufacturers to weavers and artisans. ,“At an individual level I am trying my best and pay 50% more to my artisans compared to what others pay,” said Kadri, who employs more than 300 women as spinners and runs programs for women to learn to work on spinning wheels known as charkhas. ,Pashmina industry leaders responded to the mounting crisis last summer by founding the Kashmir Pashmina Organization to advocate for their interests. The president of the association, Mubashir Ahmad Shaw, told VOA that prices for raw Pashmina will rise because of the border friction, affecting the well-being of about 700,000 people who are associated with the trade. ,The price of a kilogram of raw Pashmina has already risen from $37 to $47, according to Junaid Shahdhar, executive managing director at the Pashmina manufacturing and marketing company Phamb Fashions Pvt Ltd. ,
The industry problems are reverberating in Ladakh, where an estimated 1,600 to 1,700 nomadic families maintain a hardscrabble existence rearing the Changthangi goats that produce the precious fiber. ,“They are living a very hard life and their children don’t want to continue with it,” said Konchok Stanzin, a councilor representing a border constituency on the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council. ,Stanzin recently , to Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, requesting an allotment of land in the city of Leh for border residents who are finding life is no longer viable near the tense Line of Control that separates India from China.",https://www.voanews.com/a/india-china-standoff-puts-pashmina-wool-industry-in-jeopardy-/6328021.html,"

,"Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said China's hypersonic missile test over the summer drew ""concerns"" about Beijing's growing capability, but he said he did not compare it to Russia's launching of the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik I, in the 1950s.,""Those are terms that I wouldn't use, I don't personally use,"" Austin replied Wednesday to reporters asking whether the July 27 launch was a ""Sputnik moment."",Austin called China the U.S. military's ""pacing challenge"" but added that the U.S. was focused on ""robust capability across the board"" rather than one specific capability such as hypersonic weapons.,Even though the Chinese weapon missed its target by several kilometers, according to the ,, the test marked the first time any country had sent a hypersonic weapon fully around the Earth. Hypersonic weapons travel at more than five times the speed of sound and are incredibly difficult to track.,China has denied it carried out a hypersonic missile test, saying it was testing a reusable spacecraft.,In an interview with CBS News that aired this week, General John Hyten, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, struck a more forceful tone when discussing the hypersonic test.,""It's a very significant capability that has the potential to change a lot of things,"" Hyten said.,Asked if he would compare the Chinese test to Sputnik, Hyten replied that ""from a technology perspective, it's pretty impressive."",""But Sputnik created a sense of urgency in the United States,"" the second highest ranking general said. ""The test on July 27 did not create that sense of urgency. I think it probably should create a sense of urgency."",China has already deployed one medium-range hypersonic weapon, according to Hyten, while the U.S. is still years away from fielding its first one.,Last month, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also called the Chinese test ""very concerning."",""I don't know if it's quite a Sputnik moment, but I think it's very close to that. It has all of our attention,"" Milley said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.,Earlier in the Pentagon briefing Wednesday, Austin called on Russia to be more transparent about its troop buildup on the border of Ukraine.,""We're not sure exactly what Mr. [Vladimir] Putin [Russia's president] is up to, but these movements certainly have our attention,"" he said.,In early November, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said about 90,000 Russian troops were close to the border and in rebel-controlled areas in Ukraine's east.,A buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine earlier this year heightened tensions with the West. Russian officials said the troops had been deployed for training to counter security threats posed by nearby NATO forces.,Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has since been supporting a separatist insurgency in Ukraine's east.",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-secretary-china-s-hypersonic-missile-test-drew-concerns-/6317898.html,"

,"German journalists Adrian Geiges and Stefan Aust published the biography ""Xi Jinping – The Most Powerful Man in the World in July."",Geiges worked for many years as a foreign correspondent in Beijing for the German magazine Stern before undertaking the first Xi biography with Aust, publisher of the newspaper Die Welt.,Last month in Germany, groups affiliated with Beijing forced the cancellation of promotional events keyed to the book.,Geiges spoke with VOA's Mandarin Service reporter Bo Gu via online video on Nov. 13. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. , When we started to talk about the idea of the book, of course the first idea is you look at what exists already. And we found out nothing. There are books about China which have Xi Jinping in the title, but they're normal political books about China. So, for us, it's much more important to write this book because Xi Jinping is so important. On one hand, China is so important for the world now. On the other hand, Xi Jinping is the person who has so much power, much more power than any of the Chinese leaders before him. , Why do they know so little? One reason is, it's not so ""sexy."" In Western politics, when Donald Trump was president, for example, he tweeted crazily every day, crazy press conferences. … But in China, you have nothing like this. Xi Jinping is not giving any press conference; he's not giving interviews. ... He gives some statements, but you're not allowed to ask questions. He only tells what he likes to tell. ,Stefan Aust, with whom I wrote the book, actually did an interview with Jiang Zemin. It was quite fascinating because it was scheduled only as a photo-op with written answers. But Jiang Zemin spoke absolutely freely, even recited some German poems. That was very different.,Why did it change? China is developing such a cult personality around Xi Jinping. He's not seen as a normal person anymore. He's seen (as) someone higher, like God. If you talked to him and he gave answers, it's stupid. (It would) destroy his image as someone who's superior to everybody. ,He's smart in some ways, otherwise he wouldn't have achieved what he has achieved today. This week the Central Committee of (the Chinese Communist Party) issued this ""historic resolution,"" which makes Xi the core of the (CCP) and the country. To achieve this, you must be smart.,(After Xi took power) he immediately started this anti-corruption campaign, which was not only against corruption but also (against) people who were competitors to him or even people who might have been competitors.,He succeeded in creating a climate in China which we compare (to) the climate under Stalin in the Soviet Union. Everybody is in fear. (People) are afraid of speaking out against him. Or even to speak out about anything he might not like, simply because they're afraid. , , I think so. First, it's his personality. He likes to have the grip on power.,Secondly, all that he has done in the last years ... he must have so many enemies inside the leadership of the Party, he's afraid of losing the power.,Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution was a power struggle. Mao wanted to keep the power.,With Xi Jinping, it's the same. He's afraid of giving up his power.,It's dangerous for the development of China. In the last few decades, there were smooth transitions of power.,At the end of the Jiang Zemin administration, we knew that Hu Jintao would be the successor. At the end of the Hu Jintao administration, we knew that Xi Jinping would be the successor. But now, if Xi has an accident or illness, if he dies, there's nobody who can be in his place.,A real power struggle or fight could happen in China, and that could be very dangerous.

,"Monday’s virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping is their first face-to-face, president-to-president encounter since Biden took office: The two spoke by phone in February and September, and then-Vice President Biden met in person with then-Vice President Xi nearly a decade ago.,As these two very different men face off virtually, they are expected to discuss several weighty topics including cybersecurity, trade, nuclear non-proliferation, and the status of Taiwan.,The White House has downplayed this historic encounter, calling it a “meeting” instead of a “summit.” And analysts say they expect few, if any, concrete commitments to come of their anticipated three-hour talk Monday night.,That may be, analysts say, because each leader appears to be coming in strong with deeply held positions, entrenched personalities, and contrary strategies -- all of which will, in effect, likely maintain the current status quo.,Historian Jeremi Suri said, despite the low expectations, this is an historic opportunity for both men. Biden, like his predecessors, is coming in with a clear strategy.,“This meeting between Xi Jinping and Joe Biden, his virtual meeting, is on a scale with Nixon's visit to China in the early 1970s, Carter and Reagan and Bush and their interactions as we opened our relations with China in the late 70s, and 1980s,” said Suri, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.,“And it's as important as the meetings that occurred after Tiananmen in late 1989. In all of these meetings that I've mentioned, the president of the United States is doing two things. First, he's trying to understand where China is going at a moment of great change. Is China going in a more belligerent direction? Is it going in a more international, cooperative direction,” Suri told VOA. “So, there's the assessment of the foreign leader that the president is undertaking. And then second, there's a very important imagery of this for the public around the world. Can these two countries work together? Is it possible for us to resolve our differences? Or are we headed, as some fear, toward more and more conflict?” ,The two countries’ economies have grown more deeply intertwined to their mutual economic benefit, but in recent years their political relationship has become more strained.,Disagreements over China’s trade practices and corporate espionage led to deeper rifts during the Trump administration which were worsened by arguments over the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.Earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State Blinken admitted he sees “increasingly adversarial” aspects to the two countries’ relationship.,White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden will not shy away from frank conversations. ,“Throughout, President Biden will make clear U.S. intentions and priorities and be clear and candid about our concerns with the PRC,” she said.,Biden himself has struck a gentler tone. ,“I’ve made it clear: This does — this is competition; it does not have to be conflict,” he said last month. “There is no reason there needs to be conflict.” ,Analysts say that Xi is looking to convince Biden to ease the diplomatic and economic pressure the United States has put on China. But as importantly, Suri said, Xi is looking to affirm his standing as a powerful figure on the world stage as he faces political pressure at home.,“I think the Chinese leader will be evasive,” he said. “I think Xi Jinping will not be direct. I think his approach with foreign meetings has generally been to present a very limited set of issues and to avoid conflict but also to avoid agreement he will try to show his people at home that he is an equal to the American president and that he can come into this meeting have serious discussions, but not come out having given any concessions at all.” ,Robert Daly, the director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, says the two will need to find a way to manage their differences.,“Both sides would like to avoid conflict,” he said. “But neither side is willing to back down or change its goals. And some of those goals and interests are simply incompatible, especially in the western Pacific. So, the leaders are searching for some sort of formula that meets each other's minimal goals that will allow them to try to manage this competition, rather than have it escalate to conflict. We don't yet know what that is.” ,Both men have thrown punches into the air before this meeting, with Biden jabbing at Xi’s decision to not attend a major United Nations climate conference, saying: “they’ve lost an ability to influence people around the world.” Xi has not set foot out of China in nearly two years.,And China has counterpunched, with Xi’s foreign minister warning his counterpart ahead of talks that Biden should “stop sending wrong signals to the ‘Taiwan independence’ forces.”,This is a delicate dance, said Suri. ,For Biden, he said, “there will be red lines that he will try to draw and he will mix carrots and sticks.” ,Daly notes that the two men are equally embattled domestically, which puts them in a relatively even position. That, he says, bodes well for compromise.,“Neither man, in my view, is in a position of strength vis a vis the other right now, they're pretty equally balanced,” he said. “And that's probably a good thing; that probably will help them manage this very competitive relationship as well as possible.” ,Jennifer Bouey, a Georgetown University professor and Tang Chair in China Policy Studies at the RAND Corporation, said there are opportunities for common ground, in fighting the pandemic and on climate change. Regardless, she said, the fact that they are both willing to meet at all is a positive step forward.,“There might be many places, many issues that will have conflicts, but starting the conversation, starting the dialogue, I think it's the best solution,” she said., , , , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-xi-come-to-table-with-clear-strategies-/6314233.html,"

,"Although Australia seems likely to back Taiwan’s, rather than China’s bid, to join a major pan-Pacific trade bloc, Canberra must focus solely on their qualifications rather than link its decision to other issues, analysts say.,China and Taiwan are both lobbying for Australia’s backing of their inclusion in the 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the largest free-trade areas in the world, which was signed in 2018.,Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam currently make up the CPTPP.,China’s courting of Australia’s support comes despite Beijing’s blocking of agricultural goods that have cost Australian exporters billions of dollars. It also coincides with a period of severely strained relations because of the new AUKUS security pact among Australia, the United States and Britain, which has infuriated Beijing. ,Any temptation to bargain with China to lift punitive sanctions against Australian wine, barley and lobster exports in exchange for championing its entry into the CPTPP risks rewarding Beijing’s trade coercion, according to an expert.,“Outright favoring China over Taiwan may help regain some favor in Beijing in the short run, but at what cost? Australia will only lose in the long run by horse-trading support for China in return for some loosening of the trade blockages imposed by Beijing,” Hugh Piper, a former strategic policy adviser in Australia’s Foreign Affairs and Trade Department, told VOA. ,“It sends an awful message to Beijing that it can extract concessions from Australia simply by restraining trade,” Piper said. ,Publicly endorsing Taiwan’s campaign for admission to the CPTPP could also backfire, he said.,“Australia should be cautiously supportive of Taiwan's bid, but certainly no more enthusiastic than for any other prospective member,” Piper said. ,“Australia would lose whatever moral and rhetorical high ground it retains in its ongoing trade dispute with China if it was seen to be using the CPTPP as a vehicle for political retaliation,” he said. ,Taiwan is a significant regional economy and would be seen as a welcome addition to the cross-Pacific bloc, especially by Australia, which does not have a bilateral free trade agreement with the island, he said. ,Despite the absence of a bilateral Australia-Taiwan trade agreement, Taiwan is already a strong market for Australian exports. Taiwan was Australia's 12th largest trading partner in 2020, worth $11.9 billion, and it was Australia’s ninth largest merchandise export market in 2020, worth $7.3 billion, according to Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Major exports were coal, iron ore, natural gas, aluminum and copper.,“There's certainly no need for Australia to dial up the rhetoric on Taiwan's bid, publicly anyway. Australia's focus should be on working intensely behind the scenes to convince other current members to look favorably on Taiwan's bid, provided they can demonstrate that they meet the entry requirements,” he said.,Jennifer Hsu, a foreign policy research fellow at the Lowy Institute think tank, said Canberra has already indicated cautious support for Taiwan’s application.,“Trade Minister Dan Tehan has intimated that the Australian government and its representatives are seeking bilateral support [from other CPTPP member states] for Taiwan’s application to join the CPTPP,” Hsu told VOA. ,“So I think there is shifting perspectives, at least from the Australian government’s side, to see Taiwan as one of critical importance to the region and also to advancing Australia’s exports interests.”,While expanded tariff-free trade with Taiwan would not offset the losses from Chinese trade sanctions, it would open access to Taiwan’s technology products and provide new markets for Australia’s barley, lobster and wine.,Such a move chimes with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s public plug to Australian exporters to diversify and lessen their reliance on Chinese markets, saying in a public address, ""It is no secret that China has recently sought to target Australia's economy."" ,Supporting Taiwan’s admission into the trading bloc “is one demonstration of this process and this thinking,” Hsu said.,The bloc imposes entry requirements that include a commitment to workers’ rights, freedom of association, and a ban on forced labor.,Few believe that China would sign up to those commitments. ,China's bid is “likely to come unstuck at the point of substantive commitments to market reforms that CPTPP membership demands,” Piper said. ,“Given [China’s] ongoing prioritization of state control over market liberalization under [President] Xi Jinping, the kind of reform required for the sake of a trade agreement seems unlikely to be prioritized over the desire for control over the economy. ,“That leads to the implication that China's bid is more about strategy than economics: a move to further stymie Taiwan's international space and voice.”,China will need to pull back on any reprisal language or behavior aimed at Australia while it seeks to join the pact, Hsu said.,“The Chinese government will articulate stronger and angrier words against Australia’s support for Taiwan’s application, but the Chinese government has to balance that with what it seeks from joining the trading bloc,” she said.,“How much more can China say about Australia without harming its application to join the trading bloc? That’s the framework one has to think about: how far will China push its language and economic coercion before it backfires?” she said.",https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-caution-australia-on-linking-china-taiwan-trade-pact-to-other-issues/6311967.html,"

,"Fourteen activists who planned to participate in the Beijing provincial assembly election have withdrawn four days ahead of the November 5 vote, saying their personal safety is at risk.,Many of the activists are related to people arrested in a July 9, 2015, purge. Authorities arrested more than 300 lawyers and activists in what has become known as the 709 Crackdown.,The 14 activists declared their candidacies on Oct. 15 only to issue a joint statement on Nov. 1 saying that out of consideration of freedom and personal safety, all 14 decided to withdraw from the race. ,Wang Qiaoling, whose husband, lawyer Li Heping was arrested in the 709 crackdown, sent the statement via Twitter. It stated that 10 of the candidates had been placed under strict government supervision since declaring. Some were taken to the police station to “drink tea,” a tactic used by Chinese secret police to intimidate dissidents. Some were constrained to their neighborhoods. ,The provincial assembly focuses on street-level functions, such as establishing local policies and approving local budgets and expenses.,According to the statement, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau set up a special case team and “[the candidates] will know the result in two months.”,To become a formal candidate, a hopeful must pass a political screening process. According to an , by the state-owned Xinhua News Agency, a citizen “must first register and win confirmation of his or her qualifications for lawmaker candidacy. Then receive a nomination as ‘deputy candidate’ by political parties, social organizations, or 10 or more voters in one constituency.”,The article also said, “There is no such a thing as an ‘independent candidate,’ as it's not recognized by law.”,Wang Qiaoling told VOA Mandarin that “it’s not convenient” for her to say anything beyond the statement.,When asked whether she’s under pressure to refrain from making further comments, she answered “definitely yes.”,VOA Mandarin contacted one of the candidates, Ye Jinghuan, who replied to say because authorities are monitoring her phone, she takes calls only from close relatives.,VOA Mandarin contacted her sister, Ye Jingchun, who is also a rights activist. She said the 14 candidates had no choice but to withdraw.,“There is also pressure from their relatives and friends,” she told VOA Mandarin. “The authorities usually talk to those around you to put pressure on you, making it hard to bear the mental burden.”,Ye Jingchun, who participated in the 2011 and 2016 Beijing provincial assembly elections as an independent candidate, said this time there’s even more pressure from the authorities.,She said in 2011 and 2016, independent candidates would receive police attention only for their campaign activities. “But this year, everyone is placed under surveillance. They are no longer free to take a call from outside of the country. ... Some were forced to ‘travel,’ some were forced to stay home. I think it will last until Nov. 5, the election day,” she told VOA Mandarin. Authorities employ forced chaperoned travel to send dissidents away from events of domestic or international importance.,Ye Jingcho endorsed the high-profile announcement the 14 candidates used to declare their candidacies and then withdraw. “So, when you quit, people understand why,” she said.,Local elections will be held in the Beijing municipal area on Nov. 5 to select about 5,000 district People’s Congress representatives and more than 11,000 township People’s Congress representatives. ,Chinese , said at a central conference focused on work related to people's congresses held on Oct. 13-14 that ""Democracy, a shared value of humanity, is a key tenet unswervingly upheld by the CPC and the Chinese people.” ,The local level elections are the only ones in China that use a direct election system, where candidates who win a majority of votes will be elected as local representatives.,""We all know the chances of being elected are very small,” Ye said, “but even if I didn’t win, my neighbors, my friends get to know a little bit more about the meaning of voting, so I have no complaints or regrets.” , , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/independents-withdraw-from-beijing-s-local-election-amid-pressure-/6301050.html,"

,"Efforts by Chinese diplomats to stop cultural events deemed critical of the government in Beijing have met with mixed results in Europe, succeeding in Germany but being rebuffed by a city government in Italy.,The incident in Germany concerned a new book, ,, by two veteran German journalists, ,magazine’s China correspondent Adrian Geiges, and ,newspaper publisher Stefan Aust.,Confucius Institutes at two German universities had planned online events on Oct. 27 to coordinate with the book’s launch. But the book’s publisher, Piper Verlag of Munich, said the events were canceled at short notice “due to Chinese pressure.”,The company accused Feng Haiyang, the Chinese consul general in Düsseldorf, of intervening personally to quash the event at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Duisburg and Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.,At Leibniz University in Hannover, the Tongji University in Shanghai — which jointly operates the Confucius Institute there — forced the cancellation of an event, according to the company. Neither the publisher nor the institute offered details on what triggered the cancellation.,The institutes, run by China’s education ministry, are seen by Beijing as a way to promote its culture. Many Western countries have become wary of the influence the institutes exert on campuses by subsidizing classes, travel and research.,Dozens of Confucius Institutes have been closed or are closing in Europe and Australia. At least 29 shuttered in the U.S. after the State Department in August 2020 designated the Confucius Institute U.S. Center as a “foreign mission” of the Chinese government.,In a statement, Piper Verlag quoted a Confucius Institute employee as saying that “One can no longer talk about Xi Jinping as a normal person, he should now be untouchable and unspeakable.”,Felicitas von Lovenberg, head of Piper Verlag, called the cancellation of the events “a worrying and disturbing signal.”,Aust of , said the incident confirmed the book’s basic thesis: “For the first time, a dictatorship is in the process of overtaking the West economically, and is now also trying to impose its values, which are against our freedom, internationally.”,The book presented China in a very differentiated way as it also talked about China’s success in overcoming poverty, co-author Geiges said. “Apparently, such balanced reports are no longer enough for Xi Jinping. Stories are no longer enough — he now wants a cult around his person internationally, just as he does in China itself.”,A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Berlin said events at Confucius Institutes were planned to bring about better understanding between the two peoples, and they “should build on the basis of comprehensive communications between the partners.”,China supports the development of the institutes as “a platform to understand China comprehensively and objectively,” the embassy spokesperson added. “But we strongly object to any politicization of academic and cultural exchange.”,Both Confucius Institutes said in their respective statements that there were different views between the German and Chinese partners, making it impossible to carry on. The Institute for East Asian Studies at the University of Duisburg-Essen had expressed interest in hosting the event, according to the university’s Confucius Institute.,German human rights activist David Missal told VOA Cantonese there has always been pressure from the Chinese side when it comes to critical events, but the tactics were rarely exposed. He took it as a positive development that these incidents are coming to light.,“I think this is the only way to fight this kind of influence in a democracy — you have to make these things public, make them transparent, and then there will be political responses to these incidents,” Missal said.,Reinhard Bütikofer, a German member of the European Parliament who is critical of China, said the next German federal government must draw clear lines about its China policy. “Chinese censorship at German universities? Does not work at all. These so-called ‘Confucius’ institutes, which are in fact CCP aides, have no future,” he tweeted., ,Earlier this month, the Chinese Embassy in Rome attempted to stop a critical art show, but failed.,A museum in Brescia, an Italian city about 100 kilometers east of Milan, will continue with its plans to open a solo exhibition of the work of Australia-based Chinese exiled activist Badiucao. Scheduled to run from Nov. 13-Feb. 13, the exhibition is entitled “China is [not] near.” It will feature the artist’s work criticizing issues such as China’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and its crackdowns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.,The Chinese Embassy in Rome sent the Brescia city council a message on Oct. 21, contending that Badiucao’s works twisted facts, spread false information, would mislead the Italian people's understanding of China while seriously damaging Chinese people’s feelings, and jeopardize friendly relations between China and Italy, according to Italy’s ANSA news agency.,Brescia Mayor Emilio Del Bono told the , newspaper the show will not be canceled, adding, “I think it is important to show that you can stay friends while criticizing some things.”,Badiucao told VOA Mandarin via phone on live TV that he was not surprised by the embassy’s position. “I am very excited that the city government and the museum stood strongly with me.

,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday urged member states of the United Nations to support Taiwan's ""robust"" participation in U.N. agencies. ,The appeal is a direct challenge to China, which claims that Taiwan is part of its territory and that it has sole right to represent the island internationally.,
,
Taiwan held the Chinese seat at the U.N. for more than two decades after the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek retreated to the island as Communist forces overran the mainland in 1949. ,The seat was transferred to Beijing in 1971 by a vote of the General Assembly, but Taiwan has since been permitted to participate in some U.N. agencies.,""The fact that Taiwan participated robustly in certain U.N. specialized agencies for the vast majority of the past 50 years is evidence of the value the international community places in Taiwan's contributions,"" Blinken said in a statement. ""Recently, however, Taiwan has not been permitted to contribute to U.N. efforts."",The top U.S. diplomat said Taiwan's exclusion from U.N. forums ""undermines the important work of the U.N. and its related bodies, all of which stand to benefit greatly from its contributions."" ,

""That is why we encourage all U.N. member states to join us in supporting Taiwan's robust, meaningful participation throughout the U.N. system and in the international community,"" he said. ,

,"After experiments aimed at assimilating ethnic minorities in Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, the Chinese government now is moving to apply its cultural assimilation policy for managing all minority populations by eliminating classroom instruction in native languages. ,Late last month, Beijing released an updated blueprint for childhood development that removed a guarantee of the rights of minority children to be educated in their native language. ,The new China National Program for Child Development (2021-2030), released on September 27, omitted previous directives such as ""respect and protect the rights of children of ethnic minorities to be educated in their own language."" ,
,
Authorities changed the wording to ""promoting the common national language."" The result is that children who belong to ethnic minorities likely will be taught to read and write Mandarin Chinese, instead of their native language in the classroom. , is one of the widely used tactics of forced assimilation. Imperial and Soviet Russia attempted to quash the use of Ukrainian, Polish, Lithuanian and Belarusian. England asserted control over Wales, Scotland and Ireland by banning schooling in those languages. Authorities banned the use of Hawaiian in public schools after American interests forced Queen Liliuokalani to abdicate in 1893. ,China's latest revision goes against ,, which has encouraged mother tongue instruction in primary education since 1953. Numerous academic studies back that position, ,, which distilled the research in a 2014 blog post, saying in part, ""Children are more likely to enroll and succeed in school if they use their mother tongues."",VOA Mandarin contacted the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment on the new policy but did not receive a response. ,Pan Mei-Lin, a professor at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan, told VOA Mandarin that China's latest policies will gradually phase out the unique cultures of the targeted minority groups. ,""From the perspective of the Han Chinese, it is to increase national unity, but it's real consequence is a kind of cultural extinction,"" she told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview. There are dozens of ethnic minority groups in China but ,. What is regarded as Chinese culture is Han culture. ,Yang Haiying, a cultural anthropologist and professor at Shizuoka University in Japan, said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been quietly expanding the new assimilation policies. ,The current expansion marks a departure from the recent official policy toward ethnic minorities. In the 1980s, Beijing began promoting their cultural autonomy and worked to reduce socioeconomic inequality between minorities and Han Chinese. That position was a form of redress for the persecution and pressure to assimilate that minorities underwent during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1977. ,And although the drive to promote cultural autonomy appeared to benefit many minorities, efforts to Sinicize minority groups have been ramped up under President Xi Jinping. ,The coronavirus has helped Sinicize minority enclaves. Unable to travel outside China due to pandemic restrictions, Han Chinese tourists are visiting minority areas. ""The CCP has a strategy of commodifying the culture of ethnic minorities in an attempt to neutralize their unique and distinct identities,"" said Joyce Ho of the Human Rights Foundation in an ,. ,Yang told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview that as of early September, Chinese authorities already had changed a few regulations for kindergartens and elementary schools in central Hubei Province, home to several ethnic minorities. ,According to Yang, the local regulations were revised to eliminate the right of minorities to use their own language in schools in favor of Mandarin Chinese, the nation's official language. ,""The reason being they're Tujia and She ethnic minority groups in Hubei, and the population is very small. The calculation is that there would be less reaction to these assimilation policies, and it can serve as a pilot program for extending these policies to other ethnic minorities later,"" he told VOA Mandarin. ,Yang said that in the past, it usually would take a year or two for authorities in Beijing to extend pilot programs to all provinces. ""But now you see they are really speeding up these efforts, they don't even bother to say that 'we respect the rights of the minority groups',"" Yang added. ,Among the 56 ethnic minorities in China, Tibetans, Mongolians and Uyghurs have been the most outspoken against Beijing's repressive policies. ,The , that Beijing was using the social monitoring developed to contain the pandemic to increase surveillance in Tibet.

After collecting job advertisements by the local government for more than 10 years, Zenz concluded that Mandarin Chinese, not Tibetan, is the primary instructional language in Tibet. , has disputed his work and called Zenz ""a swindler in academic disguise."" ,The United Nations defines ""any deliberate act committed with intent to destroy the language"" as linguistic genocide, which in the 1948 International Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, is one aspect of cultural genocide, and a crime against humanity. ,Kelsang Gyaltsen Bawa, the Tibetan government-in-exile's representative to Taiwan, told VOA Mandarin he's worried about the future of the Tibetan language. ,""Before, 70% to 80% of those who live in Tibet can speak the Tibetan language fluently,"" he said. ""Now, among young Tibetans, 9 out of 10 don't know how to write our own language."",A similar linguistic erasure is occurring in Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uyghurs.,Ilshat Hassan Kokbore, director of Chinese Affairs at World Uyghur Congress, a Germany-based advocacy organization, told VOA Mandarin that in big cities, few young people are able to speak the Uyghur language. ,He added that after years of China's assimilation policy in Xinjiang, it has become difficult for locals to preserve their language, culture and identity. ""We are working hard to preserve our language and culture overseas, and we need other countries and allies to help us stop the CCP from destroying our cultural heritage,"" he told VOA Mandarin. ,In Inner Mongolia, ethnic Mongolian parents and students staged a large boycott in 2020, protesting a new bilingual education policy that requires schools to use national textbooks in Mandarin starting in the first grade of primary schools and in middle schools, replacing the current Mongolian textbooks.,Temtsultu Shotsood is the chairman of Southern Mongolia Congress, an NGO headquartered in Tokyo aimed at promoting the rights of Mongolians. He told VOA Mandarin the protests have led to the arrest of over 5,000 people. ,The CCP ""thinks that after the arrest[s], the situation is stable now. But the truth is that Mongolians are angry. They might have no channels to express their dissatisfaction for now, but on the international stage, we are reasoning with them [the CCP], we are telling them this is cultural genocide,"" he told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview. ,The , states that ""all ethnic groups in China have the freedom and right to use and develop their own spoken and written languages."" ,Anthropologist Yang of Shizuoka University predicts Beijing's next step will be to change the constitution. ""The CCP is now amending local regulations, and the next step is to change the constitution, getting rid of the language that all ethnic groups have the right to use their own languages,"" he said. ""I suspect then very likely, all the autonomous regions will be changed to provinces as well."" ,

,"With Washington and Beijing agreeing in principle that their two top leaders will meet virtually before the end of 2021, analysts are divided on whether a meeting between President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping is the only way to repair strained U.S.-China relations. ,Some analysts believe a meeting will ease tensions. Others who spoke to VOA Mandarin argued that even with a meeting between the top leaders, restarting bilateral relations will be challenging given the complexity of the issues and the long-term tension between the nations. ,Evan Medeiros, a professor at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and former President Barack Obama’s top Asia-Pacific adviser, suggested that only the top leaders can restart a dialogue between the two countries. ,“There’s really no other approach at this time that has as great a chance of working as that, because of the way the Chinese system is structured, because of how powerful Xi Jinping is, because of how centralized decision-making is,” he told CNBC.,“I think the Biden administration is right to say not that they want to cut out the middlemen, but they want to use that top-level engagement between Biden and Xi to sort of set the overall tone and direction of the relationship,” he added. ,On October 6, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, held a six-hour meeting in Zurich, Switzerland. ,This was their first in-person meeting since two days of talks in March. That encounter touched on China's actions in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet, Taiwan and cyberspace. ,The recent talks included discussion of similar issues, according to a White House statement.,Both sides called the Zurich meeting candid and productive. They announced that Biden and Xi would, in principle, hold a virtual meeting by year’s end. The last time the heads of the two nations met formally was in 2017, when then-President Donald Trump visited Xi in Beijing in November. The two met informally on the sidelines of the 2019 G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. ,Carla Freeman, a senior China expert at the Washington-based United States Institute for Peace, told VOA Mandarin that a reset of the bilateral relationship seems unlikely. ,“Relations between the U.S. and China are fraught across a range of issues. Highly sensitive issues including Taiwan and maritime issues involving US allies and partners appear particularly at risk of escalating, but of course there are other issues involving trade and technology that are areas of ongoing friction,” she told VOA in an email. ,According to Freeman, the best route now is engaging in diplomatic efforts directed toward economic “recoupling” to help provide some positive momentum in the bilateral relationship.,U.S. Trade Representative , used “recoupling” at the Q & A session after a recent speech on the Biden administration’s China trade policy at CSIS, a Washington think tank. The term means reducing the U.S. dependency on China by creating “a ,where we are occupying strong and robust positions in the supply chain.” Tai did not use the term in her speech. ,Drew Thompson, visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore and a former defense official in charge of U.S.-China military-to-military relations, told VOA Mandarin that he hasn’t seen signs that either side is seeking to recalibrate relations. ,“Both sides are pursuing their interests, and the majority of their interests and political priorities do not appear to overlap,” he said. ,Thompson pointed out that Xi is focused on achieving China's national rejuvenation, not improving the U.S.-China relationship. Many of China’s policy concepts, such as dual circulation, are designed to achieve Beijing's overall objective without the support of the United States, he said. ,Dual circulation is part of China’s plan to become self-reliant in terms of resources and technology and in terms of demand through its domestic market and markets developed in tandem with its global infrastructure programs under the Belt and Road Initiative, according to Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels, Belgium. ,“Beijing is not interested or open to discussing any of the long-standing differences in the bilateral relationship and uses dialogues for the purpose of stating their resolve not to change or accommodate the U.S. on these intractable issues,” Thompson added. ,According to Thompson, Washington is more focused on preventing the relationship with China from becoming dangerously unstable and building the U.S. society and economy.,Bilateral talks on security issues, trade and climate change show few signs of productivity, he added.,Thompson said it is telling that Xi is not participating at the upcoming G-20 economic forum and COP26, the United Nations climate change conference. His absence underscores Beijing's inward focus and the low priority placed on improving China's foreign relations, he added. ,Some Chinese experts are warning that Beijing is overly optimistic about U.S.-China relations. Shi Yinhong, a professor at China’s Renmin University and an adviser to China’s Cabinet, said at a book launch on October 12 in Beijing that the relationship between the two nations remains strained. ,""The relationship between China and the U.S. is now in a situation where tensions are still high but it is frozen or suspended there, compared with the past eight months, and it will not significantly ease in the foreseeable future,"" he was quoted as saying in the ,. ""China is a bit overly optimistic now, Chinese people always have a short memory – if the U.S. president smiles or something, they get excited."" ,Freeman said that the Biden administration has made clear it shares the Trump administration’s strategic concerns about China. ,She added that although the relationship is characterized on the U.S. side as strategic competition, if the two nations find some areas to work together on, it could become “a competitive stakeholder relationship,” which would involve a mutual commitment to working constructively on global issues. , Yet Freeman told VOA Mandarin that Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang are issues that might lead to increasing friction between the two. Yang spoke of a “red line” on the topics in a ,.,“These issues are going to continue to be areas of discord in the relationship because they are where the two countries clash ideologically, China asserts the non-interference principle against the U.S. critique and has sought to paint U.S. criticisms about its actions in Xinjiang and Hong Kong as part of a broader effort to destabilize China,” Freeman said. “The Biden administration for its part has made promoting democracy and human rights a central element of its diplomacy, making what is happening in China, as an increasingly globally influential actor, a core concern.” ",https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-split-on-biden-xi-role-in-easing-us-china-tensions-/6276328.html,"

,"The welcome committee for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was leaving nothing to chance: from the color of lettering on signs to orders on how to cover the deal that secured her return, state media were under strict instructions.,One directive from authorities instructed companies to display the slogan “Welcome home, Meng Wanzhou!” on buildings to greet the communication giant’s chief financial officer, who had been under house arrest in Canada for three years.,Others ordered media to report objectively and accurately, but in general to adopt a “low key and watered-down” treatment of the circumstances of Meng’s return.,Meng returned to China in late September after reaching a deal in which the U.S. Justice Department agreed to defer prosecution in a financial fraud case. The deal resolved a long legal and political case involving the U.S., Canada, and China.,The minute detail contained in the directive for state media on her case was revealed by China Digital Times. Since 2010, the U.S.-based, independent news site has published hundreds of directives issued by Chinese authorities to state media outlets.,From coverage of July’s Henan floods – “Shift the focus of reporting to post-disaster recovery” – to the street vendor trade in 2020 – “Please do not hype further” – and pandemic efforts at home and abroad, the , underscore the strict and sometimes strange nature of state censorship, according to analysts.,“The directives are really helpful because so much censorship is unknown,” Angeli Datt, a China analyst for Freedom House, told VOA. “The Chinese Communist Party still wants to try and make it appear as organic and natural as possible. It doesn't want to show the heavy hand of the state, even though it's there, and people know that it's there.” ,Beijing’s focus on granular details carries significance, analysts said. It demonstrates the government’s control over all aspects of the media, even when it comes to seemingly harmless topics. ,China’s embassy in Washington told VOA that freedom of speech is protected in the country.,“Chinese media, committed to objective, impartial, true and accurate coverage, has played an active role in enhancing mutual understanding between China and other countries,” an embassy spokesperson told VOA via email. “Chinese citizens' freedom of speech, a Constitutional right, has been fully protected.” ,Human Rights Watch China analyst Yaqiu Wang described the directives published by China Digital Times as “an inside look at how the system works.” ,That system has two main domains: self-censorship and government-enforced censorship, according to Wang.,Still, suppression tends to function on an ad hoc basis, she told VOA, adding, “There are no clear rules.”,That vague approach is likely by design, said Datt of Freedom House.,“Political red lines are always kept deliberately vague, because if you don't know when you've crossed it, you'll probably be more hesitant to do anything that potentially might cross it,” Datt said.,Journalists who worked at China’s state-run outlets shared a similar view, saying often staff steer clear of issues they believe may be sensitive, to avoid running into trouble.,And while they had some freedom to cover less politically sensitive news, overall the journalists said that control appears to have increased in recent years.,Tony Cheng, a British Chinese journalist, worked for CGTN from 2011 to 2020. When he first joined the network, the former Al Jazeera English and BBC correspondent said he had a lot of freedom.,“I traveled widely in the Middle East, did a lot of great stories I was very proud of,” Cheng told VOA’s Mandarin service earlier this year. “But in the last four years, I felt the editorial control tightening.” ,When China began its huge infrastructure project known as the Belt and Road policy, “suddenly Southeast Asian stories became much more prone to sensitive issues.”,Cheng, who more recently worked as a freelance journalist in the Thai capital, Bangkok, said the channel deliberately omitted some stories from Southeast Asia.,Human rights issues including the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar, unrest in Thailand, the development of China’s e-commerce site Alibaba in Thailand, and protests in Hong Kong, were all off limits. ,VOA sent emails to two CGTN press contacts for comment but received no response. ,Journalist Michael Ottey says he spent two years working as a China-based editor at the state-run China Daily from 2014 to better understand how state media operates. ,During that time, he worked alongside a Chinese editor, whom the journalist described as a “handler” or someone he had to defer to on whether certain topics were too sensitive. ,""You can criticize the enemy all day long, but you can’t criticize your friends,” Ottey, who is now an assistant editor at the Los Angeles Times, told VOA.,However, Beijing’s friends and enemies lists often changed, so the China Daily tended to censor itself on an ad hoc basis.,The outlet often looked to the upper levels of the Communist Party for signals on what or whom they could and could not criticize depending on the government’s stance at the time, Ottey said.,“It was almost like working for a public relations firm, to be honest,” Ottey said. “It wasn't really honest journalism. It was more ‘Let’s make the Chinese government look good.’”,China Daily did not respond to VOA’s request for comment. ,Steven Lee Myers, the New York Times Beijing bureau chief, said Chinese authorities “set a narrative — and that's the truth that they're talking about.”,The journalist pointed to how Beijing refers to a ""war on terror"" in Xinjiang. The U.S. and other countries have accused China of mass human rights abuses in the region, where it has detained more than a million of Uyghurs. ,“It’s a rigid orthodoxy that they’re asking people to accept,” Myers told VOA. ,He is one of around a dozen American journalists who were expelled from China in 2020 as part of a tit-for-tat with the U.S. over media visas.,China has issued directives related to allegations of its treatment of Uyghurs, including in March 2020 when media were told to avoid reporting on “Xinjiang’s organization of work positions for Uyghurs and other ethnic minority members.” ,The order came after an , alleged an estimated 80,000 Uyghurs were being used as forced labor in factories that supply foreign companies. ,As well as acting as a show of power, the directives and China’s strict censorship demonstrate Beijing’s anxieties, according to Datt of Freedom House. ,“These leaked directives are really helpful to illustrate how the state is controlling media, and restricting what is being reported on,” Datt said. But, she added, “It illustrates the insecurity of the Communist Party.” , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/china-media-directives-reveal-granular-detail-of-state-censorship/6275855.html,"

,"Cash-strapped Southeast Asian countries should look beyond China and its Belt and Road Initiative for economic help as Beijing is seen focusing more domestically, analysts say.,Regional governments have looked at the BRI to bolster their economies in coming years, but analysts have told VOA that Chinese generosity and foreign investment have limits and that Beijing is more concerned with shoring up its own economy than with new initiatives to promote post-pandemic growth elsewhere.,“In recent years we have to say that the development of BRI, for example, the trade like investment, are slowing down. It’s not as robust as, let’s say, five years ago,” Kaho Yu, principal analyst in Asia politics and energy at Verisk Maplecroft in Singapore, said.,He said pandemic lockdowns had worsened already significant delays in building infrastructure projects, with geopolitical tensions and anti-Chinese sentiment also affecting investment.,Launched in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the BRI is the centerpiece of Chinese foreign policy, with investments in 70 countries as well as in international organizations.,According to the American Enterprise Institute, signed BRI contracts totaled $46.54 billion by last year – with Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries taking the lion’s share of 36% – to be spent on infrastructure projects ranging from highways and ports to railroads and dams.,Decades of strong growth ended with the pandemic, though, and all countries suffered steep economic contractions in 2020. A much-vaunted rebound failed to materialize this year as the delta variant took hold., ,Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi toured Indochina last month after ASEAN country ministers held an online BRI summit to discuss new initiatives needed to promote post-pandemic growth.,Analyst Yu said BRI would remain a cornerstone of Beijing’s foreign policy for the foreseeable future and ASEAN, given its proximity to China, was better positioned to win investment dollars than countries in other parts of the world.,“However, having said that, it is unlikely to see those megaprojects which we have been seeing over the last few years,” he said.,Beijing’s problems at home have been highlighted by the case of China Evergrande, which has $305 billion worth of liabilities, and regulators warning of a systemic risk to the Chinese economy if its second-largest property developer fails to meet debt obligations.,David Totten, managing director of Emerging Markets Consulting, said the pandemic had resulted in Chinese companies taking “a big hit in terms of delays to their implementations” of planned projects and in terms of their financial situation.,“So probably a very good time to consolidate, focus on what they’ve got, execute, make them successful projects, and expanding into further, more peripheral locations in newer projects perhaps should take a backseat for the time being,” he said.,Beijing has also announced it will cease building coal-burning power plants abroad. The decision could affect 44 coal plants totaling $50 billion earmarked for Chinese state financing, Global Energy Monitor, a U.S. think tank, told Reuters.,“I think you’re going to see some rocky periods ahead as China’s industrial development, economic development, is retooled,” analyst Keith Loveard said.,“The statement that they will not fund overseas coal-fired power stations,” he said, “is quite a game changer for Indonesia,” a country for which coal remains a major foreign exchange earner.,In August, ASEAN granted “dialogue partner” status -- meaning higher-level access to the group’s summits -- to Britain, which is redefining itself after Brexit.Britain is the first country afforded that privilege in 25 years, joining 10 others, including Australia, China, Russia the European Union and the United States.,The Biden administration has bolstered U.S. efforts in Southeast Asia, in part, as a means of countering China, and could move forward on the US-ASEAN Expanded Economic Engagement Initiative to promote increased trade, investment, and economic cooperation.,Initially launched in Cambodia in 2012 it was part of then-U.S. President Barack Obama’s “pivot to Asia” policy, as he sought to make this region a higher strategic priority.,“The sensible thing for ASEAN would probably be to diversify their international relationships, perhaps hope that the recent change at the White House in America opens up further opportunities for them to build those partnerships,” Totten said.,However, the bloc’s relevance is being challenged by outside alliances as relations between China and Western nations hit their lowest ebb since the Cold War amid Beijing’s the South China Sea claims.,That includes a revised Indo-Pacific strategy with groups like the Quad – Australia, India, Japan and the US – emerging to further counter expanding Chinese interests, which Beijing would like to see protected by its chief ASEAN ally, Cambodia, when Phnom Penh assumes the ASEAN chair next year.,Analysts said that puts ASEAN countries in a difficult position where they will have to balance their own interests between China and the West as everyone emerges from the pandemic.,“Obviously ASEAN has taken a big hit with COVID but I think generally everybody looks forward to a resolution of that situation but in the meantime, it’s been economically very expensive for them all,” Totten said. , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/asean-urged-to-look-beyond-china-for-investment/6254434.html,"

,"The international community is renewing its focus on Afghanistan’s mineral wealth, believed to be worth more than $1 trillion, lying untapped within its often-hostile geography. ,This comes as the newly formed Taliban government faces a looming economic crisis in the country. The mineral deposits could potentially be a source of income the group is looking for. ,No media source currently available, ,The Taliban had been aware of the financial potential of the minerals well before the U.S. withdrew from the country. ,According to , one of the main sources of the Taliban’s income was “mineral exploitation.” ,The report said that in 2020, the Taliban had earned an estimated $464 million from the country’s mining sector as part of their strategy for financial independence. ,The militant group’s leaders “pursued greater financial independence for the Taliban, in part by focusing efforts on controlling unexplored mineral-rich areas of Afghanistan,” the report said. Before the Afghan government collapsed, the Taliban were already in control of 280 out of 710 mining zones. ,, a London-based corruption monitoring group, reported in June 2016 that armed anti-government elements including the Taliban earned up to $20 million annually from the, ,Analysts are waiting to see whether China will play a role in investing in and extracting Afghanistan’s natural resources. China was already investing in some of Afghanistan’s minerals before the Taliban takeover of the country.,China Metallurgical Group (MCC), a Chinese state-owned company, was awarded a contract in 2007 to develop the Aynak copper mine field in Afghanistan’s Logar province, about 32 kilometers southeast of Kabul. ,According to the then-Afghan government, , in developing the field, a project that included building an electric power plant and railroad and employing 5,000 people, mostly Afghans led by a few Chinese experts. ,MCC, however, has not been able to extract any copper because of the insecurity in the country. ,After Kabul fell to the Taliban, the company said it was willing to resume work on the project, with some conditions. ,“We would consider reopening it after the situation is stabilized and international recognition, including the Chinese government’s recognition of the Taliban regime, take place,” an unnamed official of MCC told the ,, a Chinese state-run newspaper. ,Chinese officials have called on the international community to engage with the Taliban, but they have not yet recognized the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan. ,The Taliban said they welcome China’s participation in the rebuilding of the country. ,""China is a big country with a huge economy and capacity — I think they can play a very big role in the rebuilding, rehabilitation, reconstruction of Afghanistan,"", told a Chinese state media outlet.,Experts, however, do not expect China to invest in Afghan minerals immediately.,“I do think it is too soon to tell whether China will be able to truly exploit America’s withdrawal to gain access to all these minerals,” said Craig Singleton, a fellow at Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ,“The security situation remains dire” in Afghanistan, he said, adding that “even the best-laid investment plans can go awry when the host country cannot guarantee a safe and stable security environment.” ,China will be “pragmatic and hold off on making any major moves until they have a better sense about the Taliban’s plans and intentions,” Singleton said. ,Rod Schoonover, a scientist and security expert who founded the Ecological Futures Group, told VOA he did not think the Taliban would be able to guarantee China the security and stability it needs to extract minerals in Afghanistan. ,“China does not have a long history, as I understand it, of going to highly unstable countries and working there,” he said. ,Estimating that the mineral wealth of Afghanistan could be worth from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, , had hoped the mining sector would not only help to eliminate poverty but also end the decadeslong conflict in Afghanistan. , in June 2010 reported that a team of Pentagon officials and U.S. geologists discovered in Afghanistan $1 trillion in untapped mineral deposits, which were considered much larger than any previously known and “enough to fundamentally alter the Afghan economy and perhaps the Afghan war itself.” ,A 2019 report by the former Afghan government’s Ministry of Mines and Petroleum said Afghanistan has “world-class deposits of iron ore, copper, gold, rare-earth minerals, and a host of other natural resources.” , “Afghanistan is expected to hold more than 2.2 billion metric tons (MTs) of iron ore, 1.3 billion MTs of marble, almost 30 million MTs of copper, 1.4 million MTs of rare-earth minerals, and 2,700kg of gold,” ,The reserves were not the largest in any category at the global level, but the country could become “a significant player across many markets,” the report said. ,Even with the potential financial gains from the reserves, Afghanistan’s lack of infrastructure is one more challenge to accessing the minerals in the country’s mountainous terrain. There is also the question of how efficiently mining can be conducted. ,“There is a big difference between what is under the ground and what is utilized,” said Schoonover. China’s engagement in the extraction of minerals could benefit both China and the Taliban, but he is ""skeptical"" that it will benefit the people of Afghanistan.,Schoonover said that in the absence of strong governance, he sees “the natural resources curse manifest itself,” meaning that ordinary people in many resource-rich countries do not necessarily benefit from the profits. , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/what-s-keeping-afghanistan-s-mineral-wealth-underground-/6256489.html,"

,"When Chinese President Xi Jinping last week announced his country will stop building coal power plants overseas, environmental activists were jubilant.,It’s easy to see why. China is a major financial backer of coal-fired power plants around the world, which emit greenhouse gases that cause climate change.,With China’s announcement, all the world’s top economies have now committed to ending state-backed financing for overseas coal plants. South Korea and Japan made similar commitment to end financing coal earlier this year. ,Many hope the move will create momentum ahead of November’s United Nations conference in Glasgow, Scotland, where governments will negotiate new climate change commitments.,“It is clear the writing is on the wall for coal power,” declared Alok Sharma, a British politician organizing the U.N. conference.,
, ,Not all climate experts are so confident. That’s because Xi’s promise, made during a speech Tuesday at the U.N. General Assembly, was brief and has not yet been translated into concrete policy. ,Here are some of the biggest questions about Xi’s announcement:,Xi’s speech did not specify when Beijing would stop building coal power plants overseas. He also did not say whether the new rules would apply immediately or be phased in. Those factors could be crucial for many China-funded coal projects currently underway, since the plants typically have a lifespan of several decades. ,“The Chinese government will face a lot of resistance within China from coal interests opposed to restrictions on their market,” says Christine Shearer, program director for coal at Global Energy Monitor, which documents fossil fuel projects worldwide. “However, we also know that when the Chinese government decides to do something, it can do it more swiftly and broadly than most countries in the world.”,China had already been phasing out some of its overseas coal involvement. China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which has helped build coal plants in countries ranging from Turkey to Vietnam, did not fund any coal projects for the first six months of this year.,Part of the reason for China’s shift, many analysts say, is the considerable domestic opposition to the pollution-causing coal plants in various countries, as well as the plunging prices of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind farms. ,“In over half the world, it is cheaper to build new solar photovoltaic or wind generation capacity than to keep existing coal-burning units operating — a trend projected to cover 100% of markets within the decade,” says Shearer. ,It is not clear whether Xi’s announcement covers only public financing, or if the country’s commercial banks will also be restricted from involvement in overseas coal projects. ,One possible clue came Friday, when the Bank of China, a state-owned commercial bank, said it would stop providing financing for new coal mining and coal power projects overseas starting next month.,“If Xi’s pledge includes China’s commercial banks too, this is much more ambitious than anything the West has done,” tweeted Kevin Gallagher, director of the Boston University Global Development Policy Center.,But such a move would be challenging, says Judith Shapiro, a sustainable development expert who teaches at American University’s School of International Service. ,“The central government does not fully control what various Chinese-funded entities choose to do overseas, especially when they are driven by profit rather than geopolitical reputational considerations,” Shapiro says.,Another factor: many Chinese construction companies build coal plants overseas using financing from outside China, according to a ,. It’s not clear whether Xi intends to also ban projects using such arrangements. ,“So, when Xi said ‘build,’ we'll have to see if he meant this,” tweeted one of the article’s authors, Cecilia Han Springer. ,China may be phasing out its involvement in coal projects abroad, but it’s another story at home, where China relies on coal to produce the bulk of its electricity.,The numbers are staggering. China burned over half (53%) of the coal used in the world in 2020, according to an estimate by ,.,It may not get better anytime soon, since China’s coal power plant construction continues to outpace the rest of the world. “In 2020, China built over three times as much new coal power capacity as all other countries combined — the equivalent of more than one large coal plant per week,” according to a report published by the Helsinki-based ,.,Unlike many other countries, the coronavirus pandemic hasn’t provided even a temporary emissions reprieve for China. That’s because many Chinese provinces have used coal projects to stimulate their economies during the pandemic-induced economic slowdown, says Global Energy Monitor. ,“The economic challenges due to COVID have increased pressure to maintain jobs and profits,” says Shapiro, the American University professor. “The transition away from coal is expensive, and these are costs that China is struggling to bear at this moment, given that there is a bountiful supply of coal available within the country.”,Those trends help explain why China was the world’s only major world economy to see an , in 2020.,They also raise questions about China’s ability to meet its promises of reaching peak emissions in 2030 and to become carbon neutral by 2060., ",https://www.voanews.com/a/china-vows-to-stop-building-coal-plants-overseas-but-what-does-that-mean/6246911.html,"

,"Macho men are in and effeminate male performers are out as Beijing expands its crackdown on China's entertainment industry, blaming the rise of unmanly men on U.S. influence in Japan. ,Male celebrities, even top moneymakers, are changing their images seemingly overnight now that China's National Radio and TV Administration and other government agencies have made it clear that men who can be described as ""niang pao,"" a derogatory term for effeminate men, are no longer suitable role models.,New government controls call for broadcasters to enforce a ""correct beauty standard"" and to stop booking male celebrities who fail to meet the manly criteria. ,Huang Zitao once belonged to the South Korean boy band Exo, which performs in Korean, Mandarin and Japanese. Now without eye makeup and earrings, the Chinese singer has posted shirtless ""gym rat"" selfies, showing off his muscles on social media.,And as for heartthrob Wang Yibo? Gone are his bleached blond locks, replaced by black hair. ,Jonathan Sullivan, a political science professor and director of China Programs at the University of Nottingham Asia Research Institute, called the latest development ""sad."" ,""Personal style was one of the few areas that politics had retreated from, and Chinese young people were free to find individual expression,"" he told VOA Mandarin in an email message. ""If that freedom is also subject to circumscriptions from the state, I think that is quite a sad development."",Ma, a Chinese cultural commentator who asked VOA Mandarin to use only his first name for his safety, said the latest campaign aims to ensure China has warriors ready for any future military action. ,""Promoting more gentle male characters has nothing to do with politics, but if a country is getting ready for a military conflict, enough manpower is key,"" he said. ""The one-child policy greatly reduced China's combat readiness, so the authorities are attacking the sissy men culture now to make sure they have enough manly soldiers to prepare for possible wars in the future."" ,Sullivan said the outcry around the ""crisis of masculinity"" has been growing for several years. ,""To me, the focus on the way male celebrities dress and conduct themselves is a red herring. Another instance of 'social engineering' overreach, like football players being told to cover their tattoos,"" he said. ""I wouldn't interpret this as wanting to increase the 'readiness for conflict' of Chinese men, but it is certainly in keeping with the 'robust posture' of the Xi era."" [[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWc31Szc4UU ]] ,Since ascending to power in 2012, President Xi Jinping has stressed that the Chinese Communist Party must lead all people — a position that extends its control, and his, over all aspects of life. The country's powerful tech industry and the influential entertainment sector are his latest targets. ,China's Cyberspace Administration launched a ""qing lang"" or ""clear and bright campaign"" in May with the goal of eliminating ""harmful online problems damaging young people's mental,On August 28, the ,, a state-run web portal, published photos of popular male celebrities in an article titled ""We Must Stop the Niang Pao Culture."" The term ""niang pao"" comes from a 2007 Taiwan drama in which it was used to describe a male character considered ""weak and emotional like a woman."" ,China's netizens responded quickly to the article. ""Don't judge others' beauty standards. Don't force others to agree with your beauty standard,"" said one. ,Another posted: ""All forms of beauty should be respected. Girls don't have to be feminine, and boys don't have to be masculine."" ,On September 2, China's TV regulator published new rules banning effeminate male celebrities. Broadcasters must ""resolutely put an end to sissy men and other abnormal aesthetics"" to ""vigorously promote excellent Chinese traditional culture, revolutionary culture and advanced socialist culture."" ,This week, Chinese state media renewed their promotion of an idea first presented in 2019: The U.S. has pushed an effeminate image upon Japanese men to curtail aggression in the island nation it defeated in World War II.,China's state media Global Times on Wednesday published an article, ""Japan's 'Niang Pao' Culture: A Big Chess Game by the U.S.?"" It suggested that by influencing Japan's postwar entertainment industry, the U.S. was behind Tokyo's contemporary pop culture, which spread the ideal of male effeminacy to other East Asian countries. ,Most people in China's entertainment industry believe that the effeminate male ideal originated in neighboring Japan and South Korea.,The trend began when Japanese superstar Takuya Kimura, then of SMAP, one of Asia's best-selling boy bands, appeared in a 1996 TV commercial for Kanebo lipsticks. He emerged from a romantic tangle with colored lips and the tagline ""Attack me with super lips."" Kanebo sold more than 3 million lipsticks in two months.,In 2018, under the headline , the China Daily, a state-controlled news outlet, wrote, ""Of course you can't have (Kimura), yet having a lipstick he used might just bring him a little closer to you."" ,The story referenced a lipstick campaign from the French company Guerlain, which featured Chinese actor Yang Yang, and cited many other male entertainers as the ""faces"" of Western cosmetic companies. ,Wang Hailin, the screenwriter vice president of China's National Film Literature Association, has been a longtime critic of effeminate male celebrities.,""If the most popular actors in our country are those who look gender neutral, it will pose a threat to beauty standards in our country,"" he said during a 2018 talk show appearance. ,In February, the , began promoting sports in Chinese schools by issuing The Proposal to Prevent the Feminization of Male Adolescents, a set of guidelines calling for ""vigorously developing"" activities, such as football, for ""cultivating students' masculinity."" ,Wang blasted boy bands earlier this month, saying, ""If a man pays too much attention to his outfits and his makeup, it means that he is trying to avoid responsibility and our society is going backward. …If we have more sporty and manly men, it means that our society is moving forward and improving."" ,Ma, the cultural commentator, said the entertainment industry should discuss the government's latest standard for male looks before enforcing them too strictly.,""Some like femininity and some like masculinity. We should allow different beauty standards to coexist and reach a balance point,"" he said. ""When the authorities intervene, it's hard to reach a real balance."" ,

,"U.S. experts say Beijing’s establishment of a new stock exchange catering to China’s small and medium-sized companies (SMS) is unlikely to raise the capital the enterprises had anticipated from listing on New York’s Nasdaq.,That funding step, known as an initial public offering (IPO), allows a company to raise capital from public investors. Chinese IPOs have hit a pause due to Beijing’s increased scrutiny of entities with share listings in the U.S. and new stringent reporting requirements imposed on Chinese companies that want to sell shares in the U.S.,“The impact of the new market is likely to be limited, at least compared to the impact of regulatory challenges to U.S. listing imposed by both Beijing and Washington,” Jennifer Schulp, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told VOA in an email.,“While these regulatory challenges may help the market to get off the ground by forcing companies to turn to it to raise capital, it seems unlikely that the market will be a first choice for companies that would have otherwise looked to the U.S. markets for an IPO.”,Authorities registered the Beijing Securities Exchange Limited Co. (BSE) on Sept. 3, a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the plan to raise capital and support innovation and development for SMS at the China International Fair for Trade in Services.,The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), which oversees the securities and futures industry and reports directly to the State Council, China’s main administrative body, responded by saying its leaders were ""excited"" at the prospect.,""Small and medium-sized enterprises can do great things,"" the CSRC added.,The new exchange would be similar to the Nasdaq in the U.S., which lists technology and biotech behemoths such as Microsoft, Oracle, Google, Amazon and Intel.,State-backed media , said the new stock exchange, which joins two existing boards in Shanghai and Shenzhen, will “play a significant role in the country's push for innovation-driven high-quality growth,” noting the move comes as the ,.,But George Calhoun, director of the Quantitative Finance Program at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, is dubious.,“There is an interest in creating a Nasdaq-like venue for high-tech startups, but what's impeding that is not the lack of another exchange, it's (China’s) regulatory heavy hand, and it's gotten heavier lately,” he told VOA via phone. Nasdaq is an acronym for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations.,China’s two major exchanges – the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange – serve blue-chip companies, which are regarded as stable, safe and profitable. Both exchanges also include technology boards that serve younger and riskier tech and science companies.,“There is an interest to create a venue for smaller entrepreneurial tech companies to be able to go public without the same kind of expectations that you have if you’re going to list on one of the major exchanges,” Calhoun said. “That’s where China draws the comparison with Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.”,The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), founded in 1792, is where established companies are listed, which contributes to its reputation as being safer for investors than the Nasdaq, founded in 1971. At that time, startups such as Microsoft, Intel and Apple didn’t meet the requirements for listing on the NYSE. Nasdaq listed, and thus became known, , with the NYSE, as the tech-friendly exchange for innovative science and technology companies in the U.S.,“I think China has looked at that and said, we should do something similar, and they’ve tried it twice, (the) ChiNext board in Shenzhen and Star Market in Shanghai,” Calhoun said. Both those boards list start-ups and billion-dollar tech unicorns, yet both failed due to China’s sluggish policy process for raising capital, he said.,The new Beijing Stock Exchange (BSE) will be largely based on the existing National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), or the Third Board, founded in 2012. Created for SMEs, it failed to generate the cash needed by the majority of small companies listed.,It will adopt the faster IPO registration system rather than an older method of registration that required approval by the CSRC. Regulators will allow BSE shares to rise or fall by 30% per day, a wider range than the 20% limit set for Shanghai’s Star Board and ChiNext in Shenzhen, the tech listings on those exchanges. There will be no trading limit on any IPO shares on the first day of BSE trading.,Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, told VOA Mandarin in an email that the BSE’s primary competitor will be the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) aunched by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited in 1999. The existing Third Board in Beijing will lose out, he added.,“There are a few small Chinese companies raising $10-20 million that list in the U.S. each year, in addition to more sizable companies. These small companies might list on the new Beijing exchange in the future,” he said.,The BSE is opening as , of Chinese tech companies listed in the United States.,In the U.S., there’s growing pressure to require Chinese companies to delist if their auditors aren’t audited. Gary Gensler, SEC chairman, wrote in a Sept. 13 , op-ep that unless Chinese companies allow an audit of their auditors by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, some 270 China-related companies may be prohibited by early 2024 from continuing their U.S. listings.,Wu Ming-Tse, an associate research fellow at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research in Taiwan, told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview that China’s Xi hopes that the new stock exchange will bring these companies back to Beijing.,“The purpose of this new stock exchange is to slow down the pace of Chinese start-ups going public in the United States,” Wu said.,China’s tech industry crackdown ,. Several high-profile companies, including Jack Ma’s e-commerce giant Alibaba, its financial services subsidiary, the Ant Group, and the ride-hailing company Didi, have faced investigations, fines or both.,Calhoun from Stevens Institute of Technology said China’s current clampdown has forced its tech companies into a corner.,“China is saying let’s create our own Nasdaq and let those companies come to this exchange, but what they don’t realize is that you really have to have a more liberal regime in terms of allowing companies to go public with a lighter regulation, with less red tape, less of a headwind to float their shares,” he said. “It's not about having another exchange.”,Norman Yin, a professor of finance at National Chengchi University in Taipei, told VOA in a phone interview that locating the new exchange in Beijing could be seen as reflecting Xi’s desire to grow China’s Nasdaq-like presence under the supervision of political authorities.,“If you take a look at the financial centers around the world, location is usually not a key consideration,” Yin said. “I would argue that China’s decision to set up a third stock exchange in Beijing is to allow President Xi Jinping to supervise the capital market closely by himself.” , , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-new-stock-exchange-eyes-small-medium-sized-companies/6232320.html,"

,"China’s labor laws have long stated that a workday is eight hours long and overtime must be paid to any worker putting in more than 44 hours a week.,For many of China’s workers today that describes an idyllic daily grind given the common practice of companies demanding that employees follow a ‘996’ schedule — 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week — to keep their jobs as employers have devised ways around loosely enforced laws.,Entrepreneurs such as Jack Ma, who founded the online retail giant Alibaba, and Richard Liu, chief of e-commerce platform JD.com, praised 996 as their internationally lauded enterprises made them billionaires. They have since walked back their praise, however, as the Chinese government has cracked down its wealthiest citizens.,After the deaths of two workers earlier this year at the online agricultural marketplace app Pinduoduo, long-simmering dissatisfaction in tech and other globally competitive sectors boiled over into public outcry.,Following a ruling last week by China’s highest court, employers are on notice: 996 is illegal.,“The overtime issues at some industries and companies have come to the public’s attention,” the Supreme People's Court said in its decision. “Legally, workers have the right to corresponding compensation and rest times or holidays. Obeying the national regime for working hours is the obligation of employers. Overtime can easily lead to labor disputes, impact the worker-employer relationship and social stability.”,Last week’s ruling comes as the Xi administration moves to boost the birthrate, even as Chinese couples , and many young Chinese, fed up with a culture of overwork, are "","" to express their frustration.,China’s courts and ministries will now develop guidelines to resolve future labor disputes, according to the Aug. 26 ruling, which cited numerous cases focused on required overtime — most but not all of which involved tech companies.,In one case, a courier delivery company employee identified as Zhang was required to work a 996 schedule in 2020. He refused citing China’s labor laws.,The company fired him, saying he had failed to fulfill his duties.,Zhang filed a lawsuit against his former employer for wrongful termination.,The high court ruled in favor of Zhang, citing ,, saying overtime is capped at 36 hours per month. “The firm’s required working hours violated the Labor Law, thus it is deemed illegal,” the high court said in its order to pay Zhang 8,000 RMB or about $1,230 dollars for illegal termination.,Another case involved the labor rights violation of a man identified only as “Li” who died of overwork in December 2018. That year, Li had less than three days off in August, September and November, during which he worked 319, 293 and 322.5 hours respectively. His survivors sued the company shortly after his death.,The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security recognized the death as a work injury, according to the court, which ordered the company to pay 766,911 RMB or about $119,000 dollars to Li’s family in compensation, saying his “right to rest was severely violated.”,In May 1995, , — standard in the U.S. and many other developed countries.,Since then, many big tech firms and private companies, driven to maximize profits, trim labor costs and compete in a global marketplace, have adopted the 996 model. In 2019, Ma famously said on China’s Twitter-like social media platform Weibo that “It’s a blessing to be able to do 996.”,""If you are not doing 996 when you are young, when can you do it? If we are doing things we love, 996 is not a problem at all,"" he wrote. , after vocal criticism from Chinese netizens.,Li Qiang, founder and executive director of the New York-based China Labor Watch, told VOA Mandarin that the 10 cases, all found in favor of the workers, are an important signal that the 996 practice may be coming to an end.,“China has many laws restricting overtime and forced work, but there were no legal precedents to follow,” he told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview. “These 10 cases send a signal that China’s existing laws could be implemented.”,Li also pointed out that the move might have certain political goals, as Chinese regulators have begun cracking down on the country's tech companies ,. But it’s possible, he added, that companies will develop certain “countermeasures.”,“We still need to wait and see if the 996 culture [will] actually disappear,” he said.,Teng Biao, a Chinese human rights lawyer who is a visiting professor at the Pozen Family Center for Human Rights at the University of Chicago, told VOA Mandarin that while the court’s warning is a step in the right direction, he worries about enforcement.,""In many places in China, businessmen and government officials have overlapping interests, so the protection of labor rights is very difficult,” he told VOA Mandarin by phone.,Liang Xiaojun, a lawyer at Beijing’s Daoheng Law Firm, said the warning also has something to do with China’s recent push for the three-child policy and its , to reduce the costs of raising kids — all part of a bid to boost population growth.,“They aim at reducing working hours, so young people have time to fall in love, get married, and have kids,” he told VOA.,Li from China Labor Watch argued that the ultimate protection of workers’ rights lies in the formation of an independent union that will represent employee interests and rights.,The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the only labor union in China, says in its charter that the union is “a mass organization of the working class led by the Chinese Communist Party.”,“Without independent labor unions, workers’ rights can’t be properly protected,” Li warned. “The Chinese Communist Party could potentially have a regulation to protect workers’ rights today, and another regulation to protect the companies’ interests tomorrow.,“In the end, no one is really protected.” ",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_voa-news-china_chinas-high-court-warns-employers-996-schedule-illegal/6219221.html,"

,"More than half of Americans questioned in a new survey said they favor using U.S. troops to defend Taiwan if China was to invade the island. Analysts say that reflects a growing awareness in the United States about Taiwan and the challenges it faces.,The Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey found that 52% of Americans support using U.S. troops to defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion of the island. A smaller percentage of respondents — 19% — supported a U.S. defense of Taiwan when ,.,The poll also found that 69% of those surveyed support U.S. recognition of Taiwan independence, ,. The survey, published Aug. 25, was conducted from July 7 to July 26 this year through an online questionnaire. The sample included 2,086 adults, age 18 or older, living in 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.,""I think there's growing awareness in the United States about Taiwan and the challenges that it faces,"" Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia Program at the Washington D.C.-based German Marshall Fund, told VOA Mandarin.,She added that China's military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan have been widely reported, making Americans more supportive of Taiwan and more sympathetic to Taiwan's plight.,, when the Chinese Communist Party assumed power in mainland China after years of civil war.,Beijing, however, maintains that Taiwan is a renegade province. In July, in a speech celebrating the 100th anniversary of the CCP, China President Xi Jinping pledged to pursue reunification and vowed to ""smash"" any attempts Taiwan might make for formal independence.,The U.S. cut its formal diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1979, when it formally recognized the Beijing government. Since then, Washington has maintained a , to guide its relations with Taiwan. In practice, however, it means that Washington recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China as ""the sole legal Government of China,"" but it balks at acknowledging Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.,In 2019, Xi proposed that China rule Taiwan under the ""one country, two systems"" framework negotiated for the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China. Taiwan, pointing to China's tightening grip on the former British territory, rejected the offer.,Current U.S.-China tensions factored into the survey results. The survey said that the public's distrust of China makes people more supportive of Taiwan. Thirty percent of Americans see Taiwan as an ally; another 30% see it as a necessary partner. The survey also found that 32% of respondents see China as a rival and 29% view it as an adversary.,""While a significant portion of Americans appear unfamiliar with Taiwan, a majority of Americans seem prepared to recognize independence for Taiwan should the U.S. government change its existing policy toward Taipei,"" the survey concluded.,""It is unclear how the public would react to a serious crisis in the Taiwan Strait involving the U.S. military given the public's relative unfamiliarity with the issues at hand,"" it added.,The Chicago Council's results also revealed that 65% of those surveyed support including Taipei in international organizations, and that 57% support a bilateral free trade agreement between Washington and Taipei.,Glaser told VOA she was surprised at the percentage of Americans who think the U.S. should recognize Taiwan as an independent country. ""I think Americans, not surprisingly, don't understand all of the complicated factors involved in that kind of decision,"" she said.,She pointed out that the results of the survey had a lot to do with how the questions were asked.,""If you asked Americans, 'Should the United States recognize Taiwan as an independent country even if it would lead to an all-out war with China?' You'd probably get a different response."" she said.,Julian Ku, an expert on China's relationship with international law and a law professor at Hofstra University, agreed that the polling results suggest that Americans have limited knowledge of Taipei.,He wrote on Twitter that while this trend toward much greater public support for defending Taiwan is important, ""it is very iffy to use polls as a basis for foreign policy."",Glaser agreed, telling VOA that public opinion should be taken into account, but it shouldn't be the decisive factor in the formation of any policy.,""At the end of the day, what this poll reveals to me is that we need to have a lot more education for Americans about these kinds of subjects,"" she said.

,"Smart home thermostats. Smart home security cameras. Smart refrigerators. Smart TVs. Smart pet feeders. Smart breast pumps.,From rooftop to basement and the bedrooms in between, much of the technology making consumer products smart comes from a little-known Chinese firm, Tuya Inc. of Hangzhou.,Tuya says as of 2020, its services cover more than 1,100 categories, such as healthcare, agriculture and apartment management, and are sold in more than 220 countries and regions globally in over 116.5 million smart devices. ,More than 5,000 brands have incorporated Tuya’s technology in their products, including Dutch multinational Philips, and TCL, the Chinese electronics company that makes Roku TV, according to the company. Global retailers Amazon, Target and Walmart sell consumer products that use Tuya’s technology.,Some cybersecurity experts worry about the lack of protection for the consumer data collected by Tuya tech in household items and in products used in health care and hospitality. ,The experts are urging Washington to limit or ban Tuya from doing business in the United States, in part because a broad new Chinese law requires companies to turn over any and all collected data when the government requests it. ,“If you think about this as a safety issue, you can't buy a toy with broken glass in it. You can't buy expired medicines,” said Vince Crisler, CEO of Dark Cubed, a cybersecurity firm in Arlington, Virginia. “Could these devices be considered a safety issue and therefore there is a certain level of standards? I think that's absolutely a starting point where Congress could legislate.”,In October 2020, Republican Senator Marco Rubio introduced the Adversarial Platform Prevention (APP) Act “which would establish a set of data protection and censorship related standards and restrictions that must be met before high-risk foreign software … is permitted to legally operate in the United States.” ,VOA Mandarin contacted Rubio’s office for comment on Tuya but received no response.,Tuya technology provides the function known as “platform as a service” (PaaS), which enables things to be “smart” by providing them with an internet connection. The smart devices then create a large, inter-connected network. ,This interlocking chain is the so-called internet of things (IoT). While this allows devices to work with little human intervention and makes life easier, the connected devices generate “loads of data that can be used to make the devices useful but can also be mined for other purposes. All this new data, and the Internet-accessible nature of the devices, raises both privacy and security concerns,” ,.,Backed by Tencent, the Chinese tech conglomerate with close ties to Beijing, Tuya is one of the leading enterprises in the sector less than a decade after its founding in 2014. It raised,$915 million when it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in March.,Cybersecurity experts see Tuya’s data collection as similar to that of Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its 5G-related products because Tuya could “siphon the masses of data – including classified government data – created and shared on its networks, and make it available to the Chinese government,” said an analysis published on the political website, The Hill. “Tuya may well be funneling the information picked up on home security cameras and connected health devices – just to name two examples – back to Beijing.”,The article, by two senior researchers from the Washington think tank American Enterprise Institute (AEI), suggests that the U.S. needs to limit Tuya’s expansion in the American market.,Klon Kitchen, one of the authors and a cybersecurity expert, told VOA Mandarin via email that the central concern is that companies like Tuya must comply with China’s new Data Security Law.,That law stipulates that Chinese enterprises and individuals must support, assist and cooperate with law enforcement on data concerning the national economy, national security and the public. The June 2021 law also forbids any company in China from providing any foreign law enforcement officials with data stored within China.,“This data might be collected, moved, and held in a ‘secure’ fashion … but it must still be given to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) and therefore there is a persistent threat that must be addressed,” Kitchen said. “Tuya doesn’t have to be incompetent or malicious to be a threat, it only needs to be compliant with Chinese law.”,Tuya has not responded to VOA Mandarin’s request for comment. According to an editor’s note that appears with The Hill analysis, “Regarding the potential for sharing data with the Beijing government, Tuya states that all user data on its platform is assigned to specific regional data centers, according to the users’ locations, and that servers operate independently with no connection to China.”,Scott Ford, CEO of the Kansas City-based tech start-up Pepper, told VOA Mandarin that the industry needs to regulate data flows.,“Let's say that a foreign platform has access to 10 million U.S. households or more; that's a growing risk here,” he told VOA in an interview conducted via Zoom. “The ability to turn everybody's thermostat up at once and create a power grid issue, the ability to access video at any time ... and there's no regulatory environment, there's no protections for those types of things today.”,Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst at the market research firm TECHnalysis Research of Foster City, California, told VOA Mandarin in an email that there should be concerns about Chinese companies with strong ties to the government.,“The truth is, the potential negative impact from a massive [Internet of Things]-related attack could be much worse than any 5G-related concerns,” he said. “There are hundreds of millions of connected IoT devices in use today, some of which have personal information such as live video feeds or other data, that could be used for nefarious purposes.”,In March, Dark Cubed studied 10 home smart devices sold in the U.S. market. Priced from $20 to $100, Chinese smart technologies were embedded in most of the items.,“Every IoT device we reviewed had a business connection to China and every product was observed communicating with infrastructure in China, without our permission,” said the report.,Crisler of Dark Cubed told VOA Mandarin that the company found numerous security risks in smart-device apps developed by Tuya.,“There was a lot of potential for information leaks,” Crisler said. “Tuya owns the entire chain ... and there's no insight into how they're using that data.”,Last year, the U.S. passed the Cybersecurity Improvement Act, which covers cybersecurity for IoT devices owned or controlled by the federal government. And the Biden administration has continued an executive order signed by former President Donald Trump in 2019 to protect sensitive data from foreign adversaries.,“The United States must act to protect against the risks associated with connected software applications that are designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned or controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of, a foreign adversary,” ,.,Kitchen said this is a start.,“Tuya is the overwhelming market leader and is quickly gaining a foothold in the U.S.,” he said. “We must address the larger issues beyond Tuya, but we cannot wait for the perfect solution while allowing the CCP to dig deeper and deeper into American IoT infrastructure.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_voa-news-china_cybersecurity-experts-worried-chinese-firms-control-smart-devices/6209815.html,"

,"Canada’s decision to reopen its borders to international visitors is encouraging tourism operators in tiny Prince Edward Island, who are hoping the Asian visitors who have become a mainstay of the province’s economy will soon be back.,
,
Best known in Asia as the setting for the “Anne of Green Gables” novels, this province in Atlantic Canada has long been a magnet for visitors — especially from Japan and more recently China — who come to visit the house where the century-old children’s stories are set.,But travel restrictions imposed by the federal government last year in response to the coronavirus pandemic brought all of that screeching to a halt, reducing overall visits to the island by 70% compared with pre-pandemic levels, according to provincial officials.,Prospects brightened this month when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that fully vaccinated Americans would be able to enter Canada for nonessential travel beginning on August 9, and that visitors from other countries would be admitted as of September 7.,That is good news to George Campbell, who operates a museum in the real-life house where author L.M. Montgomery set the early 20th-century stories that have more recently been made into a movie and a Netflix series. Fans of “Green Gables” from China are an important part of his clientele.,
,
“We are eager to have Chinese tourists visit our province and my museum,” Campbell told VOA ahead of a reporter’s visit to the white clapboard house with its iconic green gables. “It is wonderful that they will travel so far to come and visit.”,
While it was Green Gables that put Prince Edward Island on the map for many Asians, enterprising islanders have been quick to offer the visitors other ways to spend their money.,
,
According to the federally funded Canadian Broadcasting Corp., bus tours have been established that cater to Chinese tourists, and golf courses have begun offering Motion Pay, a payment system favored by many Chinese.,
,
Wang Shoutao, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa, told VOA that visitors from his country have been attracted to other parts of Canada as well.,

“In recent years, tourism exchanges between China and Canada have been developing, and Canada has become a very important destination for Chinese tourists,” he said without addressing recent friction between the two countries over the detention of two Canadian citizens in China.,
A formal statement provided by Wang said, “Friendship between the peoples holds the key to sound state-to-state relations, and heart-to-heart communication contributes to deeper friendship.”,
,
For Prince Edward Island, the personal connections forged by tourism have led to more permanent links. Until it was supplanted by India in 2017, China had been the largest source of new immigrants settling in the province for a decade., newspaper reports that 2,400 Chinese newcomers arrived in 2006-09, making a visible impact in a province of 160,000 people whose main industries are tourism, potato farming and fishing.,
,
The province, located at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River, is also looking for new business opportunities with China, according to Peter McKenna, a professor at the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI).,
,
“I would say that the province is interested in examining possibilities and the potential for greater linkages with China,” McKenna told VOA. “One of those areas would be in the fishing or the seafood sector. I think there are opportunities there for companies in PEI and Atlantic Canada in general to develop a market in China.”,Jeffrey Collins, another UPEI professor who works on trade policy for the provincial government, agreed that trade with China is important to the island but said it is still far overshadowed by the exchange of goods and services with the United States.,
,
“PEI's export growth to China, as impressive as it has been in recent years, is very much based on a handful of products, chiefly lobster,” he said. While that trade remains “robust despite larger geopolitical tensions,” he noted, “key limitations are in transportation access and need to develop deep business cultural ties with Chinese buyers/consumers.”,
,
While the Asian influx has been a boost to the island’s economy, not everyone in the province’s tightly knit community has been happy to see the growing numbers of what are often described by longtime Atlantic Canadians as the “come-from-away.”,“If anyone in PEI tells you that there is no racism, they’re lying or not aware of what’s going around,” said Satyajit Sen, a policy adviser at the Federation of Prince Edward Island Municipalities. “It exists and you can sense it, especially during the COVID times.”,
,Sen, who spoke to VOA in a Vietnamese-run coffee shop, said the island’s enviable standard of living, which he also enjoys, cuts both ways when it comes to the small-town mindset.,
,
“It could be a sense of insularity, a sense of island-ness, which is largely a positive, but which can also be a negative if people come from away, which is not a good term to be honest with you.”,Anxiety about outsiders has been heightened during the pandemic, which has infected relatively few people here. Sen said this has led to people vandalizing cars with license plates from outside Prince Edward Island.",https://www.voanews.com/a/americas_canadas-green-gables-museum-hopes-early-return-asian-tourists/6208911.html,"

,"Nearly a year's worth of rain fell on the Chinese city of Zhengzhou over four days this month. Flooding killed 71 people, including 14 trapped in a subway station as waters rose.,Zhengzhou is part of a Chinese government initiative to build ""sponge cities"" in response to increasing urban flooding across the country. These cities aim to use natural processes to soak up rainwater rather than sending it coursing through concrete drainage pipes and channels that can get overwhelmed or cause other problems.,These systems are catching on around the world as city planners embrace the benefits they provide, such as stormwater management, urban cooling and aesthetic appeal.,But experts say the storm that drowned Zhengzhou was more than any city's drainage system could handle. And because of climate change, these kinds of storms are becoming increasingly common around the world.,""The intensity, the frequency of the storm events is much greater than we've been used to,"" said Neil Weinstein, executive director of the Low Impact Development Center, a nonprofit group focused on sustainable stormwater management techniques.,""The sponge city concept ... is really good at slowing down modest-sized storms,"" said David Sedlak, civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ""But it's not a replacement for the flood control infrastructure that many of our cities need to protect us from these super big floods and storms that arrive in a short period."",China launched its sponge city project in 2015 with 16 pilot cities. Another 14 were added the next year.,The move was a response to increased flooding in Chinese cities following the country's rapid urbanization.,In 2000, just over one-third of the Chinese population lived in cities. In 2019, that figure reached 60%, ,.,Building those cities meant paving over forests, fields and farmland. Unlike the green areas they replaced, pavement and the roofs of buildings do not absorb rainwater.,As the area covered by these hard, impervious surfaces increases, so does the amount of water running off of them during rainstorms.,""Runoff all of a sudden has nowhere to go,"" said Colleen Chiu-Shee, a graduate student at MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning. Big storms can overwhelm drainage systems and lead to flooding.,At the same time, urbanization is leading to water shortages in some cities. Drainage systems designed to quickly move water off city streets do not give rainwater a chance to seep into the ground and recharge underground water sources.,Other cities worldwide have dealt with the same issues. For example, in Washington, D.C., and other U.S. cities, increasing development has led to untreated sewage spilling into streams when heavy rains overburden the sewer system.,Beginning in the 1990s, urban planners in the Washington suburb of Prince George's County, Maryland, began looking to natural systems to help control stormwater problems. The concepts, originally known as low-impact development, have traveled around the world under various names.,The basic idea is to get away from concrete pipes and channels that quickly move water out of the city. Instead, the goal is to slow down the water and give it a place to soak into the ground.,At its simplest, this includes grass-lined ditches called bioswales on roadsides or parking lots. At the other end of the scale are large constructed wetlands that absorb water and remove some forms of pollution.,Plants are key components of these systems. They absorb water through their roots and release it into the air from their leaves. The roots also help aerate the soil to allow more water to infiltrate the ground.,The presence of plants is why these systems are also known as ""green"" infrastructure, and it differentiates them from traditional ""gray"" infrastructure that relies on concrete and pipes.,Green infrastructure also has added benefits, Sedlak said. ""One is that by growing more trees and vegetation in the city, you cool it and make it more livable. The other is, you infiltrate more of that water into the ground and you have a chance of getting that water back out later as a water supply."",That's why China calls them ""sponge cities,"" said Shaw Yu, a retired University of Virginia civil and environmental engineering professor. They absorb water when it rains, ""and then when water is needed, it could be pumped out, like when you squeeze the sponge."",Researchers are reviewing the sponge city program, and so far, ""the results are very mixed,"" MIT's Chiu-Shee said. A lot depends on who is running the program and the priorities of the investors and developers, she added.,But no city is designed to deal with the kind of rain that soaked Zhengzhou, or the flooding that struck Germany and Belgium earlier this month.,""The whole world is learning about how badly climate change can really affect cities nowadays,"" she said. ,

,"The U.S. Justice Department on Monday announced charges against three Chinese intelligence officers and a Chinese computer hacker in connection with an unlawful cyber campaign that pilfered trade secrets and confidential information from dozens of companies, universities and government entities in the United States and 11 other countries between 2011 and 2018. ,The theft included information about sensitive technologies, that was ""of significant economic benefit to China's companies and commercial sectors,"" the department said, adding that the hackers targeted research institutes and universities to steal infectious-disease research on Ebola, MERS, and HIV/AIDS. ,Like the closely related Ebola virus, the Marburg virus can cause massive internal bleeding, organ failure, fever, shock and delirium, and usually death. Tularemia is a potentially fatal bacterial disease found in rabbits. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people could become exposed through bioterrorism. ,The announcement came as the administration of President Joe Biden and its allies formally attributed a massive cyberattack on the Microsoft Exchange Server email software earlier this year to hackers tied to China's Ministry of State Security. ,""These criminal charges once again highlight that China continues to use cyber-enabled attacks to steal what other countries make, in flagrant disregard of its bilateral and multilateral commitments,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco said in a statement. ,Prosecutors identified the three intelligence officers as Ding Xiaoyang, Cheng Qingmin, and Zhu Yunmin, saying they served in the Hainan State Security Department (HSSD), a provincial arm of China's Ministry of State Security. The computer hacker was identified as Wu Shurong. ,In an indictment unsealed Friday, prosecutors alleged that the three intelligence officers coordinated with staff and professors at various Chinese universities to carry out the campaign. The universities helped the Chinese spy agency to identify and recruit hackers and linguists, they said. ,To hide the Chinese government's role in the cyber campaign, the four defendants and other Chinese intelligence operatives established a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Co., Ltd, prosecutors said. The company has since been disbanded. ,In addition to organizations in the United States, the hacking campaign targeted victims in Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, prosecutors said. ,""The breadth and duration of China's hacking campaigns, including these efforts targeting a dozen countries across sectors ranging from health care and biomedical research to aviation and defense, remind us that no country or industry is safe,"" Monaco said. ""Today's international condemnation shows that the world wants fair rules, where countries invest in innovation, not theft."" ,In recent years, the Justice Department has charged dozens of Chinese nationals with espionage and cyberattacks. ,The Chinese government has long denied U.S. allegations that it carries out cyberattacks against the United States. ,The U.S. and its Western allies accused the Ministry of State Security of using ""contract hackers"" to carry out a wide range of cyberattacks including ransomware attacks targeting companies in exchange for millions of dollars in ransom. They specifically blamed China for the cyberattack in March that affected tens of thousands of organizations via Microsoft Exchange servers. ,""The United States and countries around the world are holding the People's Republic of China (PRC) accountable for its pattern of irresponsible, disruptive, and destabilizing behavior in cyberspace, which poses a major threat to our economic and national security,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. ,The public attribution is likely to strain already sour relations between Washington and Beijing and comes at a time when U.S. officials continue to sound the alarm about Chinese cyber espionage activities as part of Beijing's campaign to supplant the United States as the world's only superpower. ,An advisory released on Monday by the FBI, the National Security Agency, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said Chinese state-sponsored malicious cyber activity is ""a major threat to U.S. and Allied cyberspace assets."" ,""Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors aggressively target U.S. and allied political, economic, military, educational, and critical infrastructure (CI) personnel and organizations to steal sensitive data, critical and emerging key technologies, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information (PII),"" the joint advisory said. ,The U.S. views China as ""a prolific and effective cyber-espionage threat"" and says it ""possesses substantial cyber-attack capabilities,"" according to the U.S. intelligence community's latest threat assessment released in April. ,

,"At least 25 people are dead in China’s central Henan province after massive floods triggered by several days of heavy rains. Weather forecasters are predicting three more days of rain for the region.,
,
The rains washed out streets throughout the provincial capital, Zhengzhou, forcing stranded motorists to wade through waist-deep waters that submerged cars and sent many floating away. ,
,
The floods also washed out the city's subway system, with riders posting videos on social media awaiting rescue in waist-high muddy waters. A passenger named Xiaopei posted on Weibo that “the water in the carriage has reached (their) chest.” ,
,
Twelve people died and more than 500 were rescued after a subway tunnel flooded, state media reported.,
,
Dozens of reservoirs and dams have reached critical levels, with local authorities warning that the Yihetan dam in the nearby city of Luoyang had sustained a 20-meter breach and was on the verge of imminent collapse. ,
,
Authorities have evacuated 100,000 residents to safe zones. The central government dispatched units of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police to assist with flood control and relief efforts, ,, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ,
,
“Our hearts go out to the people in affected areas. We believe that the people of Henan will tide over the disaster and do a good job in flood control and disaster relief as well as post-disaster recovery,” he said, adding that there had not been any reports of foreign casualties in Henan.,
,
Henan province, home to about 94 million people, has experienced severe rains through the past week. Forecasters say Zhengzhou received as much rainfall in three days as it normally gets in a year.,On July 19, the Meteorological Administration posted a warning on its official Weibo account that said, ""Tonight to tomorrow during the day Zhengzhou area will have rainstorms, some areas will have torrential rain. Please avoid low-lying, waterlogged sections and drive safe."" ,
,
A media worker in Zhengzhou, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from authorities, told VOA Mandarin on July 20 that she didn’t take the warning seriously at first. “There was nothing two days ago. It started to rain yesterday and hasn’t stopped today. Now the city roads are full of stagnant water.” She added that cars were drifting in the flooded roads. ,
,
""I am really scared about the power failure and being at home alone,” posted one resident on Weibo. “My cell phone is dying, and water is leaking in through the balcony. I’m sitting on the floor, crying.” ,
,
Other netizens asked for help online, ""We have a pregnant woman at home whose water broke. The baby is coming any minute. We waited for the ambulance but were told they can’t send any. Can any OB doctors or hospitals nearby help?”,
,
A representative of the city of Xu Liyi, a member of the Standing Committee of Henan Provincial Party Committee, and secretary of the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee said the high levels of rainfall were unusual. ,
,
Extreme weather events have surged this summer in China, with recent flooding in Sichuan province killing hundreds of citizens and forcing thousands to evacuate the area. Officials of Greenpeace International, an environmental group, warn that China’s rapid urbanization will increase the frequency of climate disasters. ,
,
In Beijing, where heavy rains flooded some neighborhoods, a real estate agent who wanted to remain anonymous told VOA Mandarin that the intensity of the current rainstorms is similar to those that left dozens dead in 2012. ,
,
“My coworkers live in Beijing Tiantongyuan. Their cars are flooded with water covering the wheels,” he said, adding that the rains had caused roads to collapse and big rocks to come loose and careen down steep areas. ,

,"American researchers using commercial satellite imagery say China appears to be significantly expanding the number of launch silos for its arsenal of intercontinental range ballistic missiles, raising fears that nuclear weapons will become a new issue of contention between Washington and Beijing. ,Using images provided by the satellite imaging company Planet, two researchers from the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey (California) found that China is building 119 silos in the desert of the northwestern province of Gansu. ,Jeffery Lewis, one of the researchers, told VOA that development is likely for China’s DF-41 ICBM, which is believed to be capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads. With an estimated range of nearly 7,000 kilometers and possible capability to carry up to 10 warheads, researchers believe the ,.,“We believe China is expanding its nuclear forces in part to maintain a deterrent that can survive a U.S. first strike and retaliate in sufficient numbers to defeat U.S. missile defenses,” Lewis said in a summary of findings provided to VOA. ,In response to the findings, the State Department said that the U.S. is concerned about China’s rapid expansion of its nuclear capabilities. ,""These reports and other developments suggest that the PRC's nuclear arsenal will grow more quickly, and to a higher level than perhaps previously anticipated,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a briefing on Thursday. ,He called the buildup “concerning.” “It raises questions about the PRC's intent. And for us, it reinforces the importance of pursuing practical measures to reduce nuclear risks,"" he continued, ""We encourage Beijing to engage with us on practical measures to reduce the risks of destabilizing arms races - potentially destabilizing tensions."",The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request from VOA for comment. ,In 2020, the ,, and will double that number in the coming years. ,The researchers said the 119 new silos are spread across approximately 1,800 square kilometers near Yumen, a city in Gansu province, with each spaced approximately 3 kilometers apart. Images show that construction began in March 2020, but most building was done since February 2021, “suggesting an extremely rapid pace of construction over the past few months,” the summary said. ,Timothy Heath, a senior international and defense researcher for the policy research group the RAND Corporation, told VOA by email that the silos raise the credibility of China’s nuclear force.,“It shows China intends to expand its inventory of nuclear weapons. This means China is raising the potential risk and cost of escalation in any conflict along China’s periphery,” he said. ,Other researchers warn that the calculations might be worst case scenario assumptions. James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said there are a lot of questions to ask before concluding that China is expanding its nuclear arsenal at such rapid speed.,In an article published in ,, Acton said that there are still debates regarding how many warheads China’s missiles can carry. He also pointed out there is a possibility that China is mirroring the approach called the “shell game” designed by the United States in the late 1970s for basing some of its missiles. ,During the Cold war, the United States created a plan to build multiple launch shelters for each missile, 23 for one to be exact. The missiles were regularly moved among silos to make it impossible for the Soviet Union to target U.S. land-based ICBMs. The plan was adopted by the Carter administration but was later changed by the Reagan administration. ,Lewis agreed that that is a possibility. “China likely has similar concerns about the survivability of silo-based ICBMs, and may rotate a smaller number of ICBMs among a larger number of operational silos,” he added. ,Acton also pointed out that China still has a relatively small nuclear arsenal compared to the U.S. According to the Pentagon, China has a warhead stockpile in the low 200s. “For comparison, the United States possesses around 3,800 nuclear warheads, of which around 1,750 are deployed,” ,. , for negotiations on nuclear arms. In May, the U.S. disarmament ambassador, Robert Wood, said at a U.N. conference that China continues to resist discussing nuclear risk reduction bilaterally with the U.S. China's envoy, Ji Zhaoyu, responded by saying that Beijing is ready to engage, but only “on the basis of equality and mutual respect.”,Heath, from the Rand Corporation, said that in view of the new developments, the U.S. may seek to press for arms control talks with China, but it's doubtful China will accept such controls given the small size of its nuclear arsenal. “The U.S. may also need to build more anti-missile defenses,” he said. ,Acton said a quid pro quo might work. “If the United States wants to engage China in arms control, the kind of idea that I think is worth exploring is a quid pro quo, by which the U.S. agrees to limit its missile defenses, for example by agreeing not to develop or deploying missile defenses in space, in return for China agreeing not to produce any more nuclear material with which it could augment its arsenal,” he said in an analysis video posted by Carnegie. , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_us-concerned-about-report-china-expanding-missile-silos/6207764.html,"

,"On July 1, the Chinese Communist Party celebrates its centennial, marking its dramatic rise from a small group of idealists to a party of 92 million members that now oversees the world’s second largest economy and the world’s biggest surveillance state.,Internally, its policies color every sector of a nation with the world’s largest population, or 1.4 billion people. Externally, its model is having an impact and influence on distant economies and leaders worldwide not to mention the everyday shopper looking for a new pair of shoes.,One hundred years ago, the party began with meetings in Shanghai of a dozen or so people, who represented, at most, five times their number.,At the time, Shanghai was known for its cosmopolitan drive in an impoverished, divided country struggling to emerge from a string of humiliations by foreign powers that had controlled chunks of its territory for nearly a century.,It wasn’t until October 1949, after years of political turmoil and civil war, that Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong declared the creation of the People’s Republic of China, setting in motion more than 70 years of change.,Getting to that moment in Beijing took the party decades of battles. In its early days, the party allied with the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, in an effort to reunify and modernize China so it could ward off further encroachment by Japan.,The two parties also collaborated to “rid the nation of warlords that prevented the formation of a strong central government,” according to ,.,In 1925, Sun Yat-sen, the Nationalist’s leader and a revered CCP figure, died of cancer on March 12. On May 30, a series of strikes and protests throughout China left 11 demonstrators dead as British police responded to the anti-foreign eruption on May 30. Anti-imperialist outrage benefited the CCP which grew from a few hundred members to more than 20,000.,Sun’s successor, Chiang Kai-shek, instigated a slaughter of communists in 1927, and despite Moscow’s efforts to engineer cooperation, the two parties fell into a civil war.,By 1931, when Japan invaded Manchuria, the CCP had established itself in rural central China in part by expropriating land from wealthy owners and redistributing it to peasants.,Chiang pursued the CCP and its army, pushing them onto the Long March and off to the caves of Yan’an in China’s central province of Shaanxi giving the party its foundational myth.,In Yan’an from 1935-47, Mao Zedong rose to power, building rural support for the party and expanding it from an initial force of less than 10,000 to nearly 2.8 million members as the CCP adopted a constitution that enshrined Marxist-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The party’s rapid expansion led to more political and ideological education for newcomers, an indoctrination process that came to include even Long March veterans. Known as the Yan’an Rectification, the effort allowed the party, and Mao, to purge thousands of people suspected of disloyalty.,That was only the beginning of decades of political turmoil and internal strife.,After World War II, what had been the two parties’ united front against Japan dissolved as the full-scale civil war returned. “Eventual Communist victory seemed more and more likely,” ,.,On Oct. 1, 1949, Mao Zedong announced “The Chinese people have stood up” in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, ending the civil war and dispatching the Nationalists “backed by U.S. imperialism” to Taiwan.,For some, the moment seemed like a new hopeful beginning. Chinese then living in the West, many of them intellectuals, professionals and scholars, returned to China to participate in its rebirth. According to ,, ,, as many as 1,538 Chinese returned to China from August 1949 to November 1955.,Of those, 1,041 returned from the United States.,Mao next launched the Hundred Flowers Campaign, which encouraged people to engage in ideological debate, including constructive criticism of the Communist Party. But hundreds of thousands of people who spoke up later lost their jobs. Many were sent to labor camps as the Anti-Rightist Movement evolved. Later, repressive tactics used against the rightists evolved as part of campaigns to consolidate CCP power under Mao, including the Great Leap Forward.,Starting in 1958, Mao carried out a massive economic and social campaign that tried to remake the country’s agrarian economy into a communist ideal, but instead lead to the deaths of at least 20 million people.,The CCP and Mao again sought to consolidate power with the decade-long Cultural Revolution, which some critics believe killed as many as another 20 million people.,In 1970, amid the social chaos of the Cultural Revolution, Mao signaled a willingness to speak with Beijing’s declared enemy, the United States. U.S. President Richard Nixon traveled to China from Feb. 21-28, 1972, visiting Shanghai, Hangzhou and Beijing, where he met Mao. The countries normalized diplomatic relations in 1979.,Mao’s death on Sept. 9, 1976, effectively ended the Cultural Revolution, which was followed by the transformative reforms crafted by then-CCP Chairman Deng Xiaoping.,By opening China to foreign investment, Deng’s era led to the rapid growth of China’s economy and the first steps toward the realization of major infrastructure projects such as the Yangtze Three Gorges Dam.,But by the spring of 1989, protests and demonstrations calling for political reform to match the economic changes percolated throughout a China increasingly marked by inequality. The government quashed the biggest protest, a gathering of thousands in Tiananmen Square by ordering the troops to open fire on June 4.,Reporters and diplomats who witnessed the massacre estimated hundreds if not thousands were killed in what Chinese refer to as the June 4 Incident, or 6/4.,It is this swing between openness and crackdown that has marked CCP policies since its founding and continues to this day. The most recent clampdown has been on massive and cash-strapped Chinese multinationals like Alibaba or the implementation of advanced surveillance methods deployed to control minorities such as the Muslim Uyghurs, dissidents and people in cities facing a sudden outbreak of COVID-19.,Today, the CCP is preparing for its chairman, President Xi Jinping, to assume an unprecedented third term, even as the Party faces daunting problems ,, a ,, and environmental challenges, Xi is urging party members to remain loyal and serve the people.,To mark the CCP’s centennial, VOA Mandarin spoke with people with deep roots inside the party and China, as they reflected on their lives under CCP rule and their changing perceptions of the party. The interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.,One of the tactics that CCP leaders have employed throughout its history is purging political enemies. From Mao’s Cultural Revolution to President Xi Jinping’s current anti-corruption campaign, there have been countless attempts to solidify power by destroying enemies to purify the party ranks., ,Few understood this better than Li Rui, a longtime CCP member and once the personal secretary of Mao Zedong. He evolved from a loyal believer to one of the party’s most outspoken critics, advocating before he died in 2019 at the age of 102 for liberal reform in China.,VOA talked to his daughter Li Nanyang, a visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution, where she manages a special project on historical materials relating to her father.,“My father joined the Party when he was 20 years old, when the CCP was a small party with less than 50,000 members. At that time, he absolutely admired the old Red Army soldiers for the kind of hardship they embraced during the Long March.”,Yet just five years later, the party purged Li for criticizing its policies during the , in 1942, a campaign aimed at identifying and removing party members opposed to Mao’s leadership and policies.,“My father told me that he has suffered the least torture. He was not allowed to sleep for five days and nights. He survived, but he said that there were others that weren’t allowed to sleep for 15 days and nights,” said Li Nanyang.,According to Li Rui, this was to “rectify those intellectuals who had not yet joined the party or become a tool for spreading their ideology.”,For the party and its leader Mao, the Yan'an Rectification Movement was a success. “Party members as well as the general public were ‘reformed’ in their thinking,” Li Rui said in “Li Rui’s Oral Account of Past Events” published in 2013 in Hong Kong.,Li was purged during the Great Leap Forward and during the Cultural Revolution for criticizing Mao’s policies.,“When asked about when he changed his perception of the party, he told me it was actually not because of his prosecutions. It was in 1979, when he first came to the United States. He had only been to the Soviet Union before and didn’t realize that the West was already so rich. He told me when he set foot on the American soil, he realized that socialism might not be working,” Li Nanyang said.,“And the last straw was when the party removed the term limits on the presidency in 2018, effectively allowing Xi Jinping to remain in power for life. I think my father completely lost hope for the party at that point.”,Guo Yuhua, a well-known sociologist in China famous for her criticism of the central government, was born to an elite military family in 1956. Because of her family’s army ties, Guo joined the military in 1971 at the age of 14. Enrollment at a young age was considered a privilege at the time. ,Four years later, she joined the Party.,“I didn’t really understand why. I guess if you are in the military and not a party member, it’s just weird. People would think you were either not hard-working, or you have some problem that needed to be fixed,” Guo told VOA Mandarin.,At the time, Guo loved China and the CCP. “I was Red inside and out.”,Over time, Guo’s view of the party changed, an evolution that began in 1980, when she was admitted to Beijing Normal University. She spent the next decade studying until she obtained a doctorate degree in 1990.,“It was completely different back then. When we first entered university, we saw seniors running to be people's representatives. There were university students and young teachers, delivering campaign speeches on campus. At that time, debates and discussions were active and welcomed, Western books were allowed, and we were hopeful,” she said.,“But that all ended on June 4, 1989,” she said referring to the massacre of protestors in Tiananmen Square by the government. “After that day, I realized that it was an illusion that the CCP would push for democratic reform. Now 30 years have passed, we still don’t see the government even admit its mistake. Then the only way to rule is through lies.”,Guo officially quit the party in 2014. “In fact, I have never participated in any Party activities since I joined Tsinghua University in 2000. When they asked me to pay party dues, I gave them the receipt I got from donating to poor children in the countryside,” she told VOA.,“Before we said China was a party state, now I think it is a party society,” Guo said in reference to how CCP control has gone beyond oversight of the government and seeped into every aspect of life. “China was once a party society during the Mao era, but are things better now? I don’t think it has changed fundamentally at all.”,“We have a so-called market economy today, but who does this system work for? Take a look at the farmers and migrant workers. Take a look at the entrepreneurs whose assets have been taken away. The fundamental question is who has taken all the benefits?” she said. Answering her own question, Guo said the ruling elite of the CCP has benefited the most from the opening of China’s economy.,“I remember when I was young, the school would organize us to watch parades punishing those liberal individuals, and we would sit in the public trial for them. Looking back, if you understand the concept of universal rights, China had an insane amount of human rights violations in all walks of life during the Cultural Revolution. But at that time, it was just daily life,” Akio Yaita told VOA Mandarin., ,Yet after the Cultural Revolution, from the time he went to elementary school up until the Tiananmen Massacre in 1989, China was a country full of hope, according to Yaita.,“Honestly, everything was slowly getting better. The country’s economy was opening up, people were encouraged to speak up, it was probably the best time in China in the past 100 years,” he said.,He returned to Japan with his family at the age of 15 and was shocked by how different the two societies and political systems were.,“I thought Japan was a utopia at that time. People were friendly and the government's policy was geared to help those less fortunate. Most importantly, the media was completely different. All the news outlets served as watchdogs, they criticized politicians and held them accountable. Yet in China, all we heard was how great the leadership were, how heroic Chairman Mao was. It was very, very different,” he said.,With a keen interest in international relations, Yaita embraced journalism and has spent most of his career covering China.,In his eyes, the mission of a journalist is to expose unfairness in the system, dig out of the truth, and speak for those at the bottom of the society.,“I feel so fulfilled in my career covering China, because unfairness is everywhere,” he told VOA Mandarin.,“I have a friend, Xu Chongyang, a successful businessman who later lost all his assets from working with a few high-ranking CCP officials who defrauded him. So he begins to file petitions,” Yaita said.,“When I first met him, he was full of energy and was convinced that he could bring justice back. He was then targeted by the authorities, he was beaten, he was locked up. ... Every time I saw him, he became weaker. And every time he petitioned, he got a few more crimes (linked to) his name. He once told me, ‘In this country, you can’t really sleep easily no matter how rich you are. You just don’t know when the nightmare will come.’” ,Xu was just an example, said Yaita, who told VOA Mandarin that he has witnessed hundreds of stories. He believes these personal tragedies are caused by a system where no one has an incentive to speak for the weak.,“The rights of the weak should be protected,” he said. “Any of us could possibly experience unfortunate incidents in life, so a strong social support system is essential. But in China, this is the group that suffers the most, so no, I don’t think China is a happy country at all.” ,Meanwhile, a growing number of Chinese patriotic youth have taken defending the Chinese government and the CCP as their duty.,These so-called “little pinks,” or xiao fenhong in Chinese, emerged on Chinese social media and became a popular term after the 2016 Taiwan election, when pro-independence leader Tsai Ing-wen won the race.,Beijing views Taiwan as a wayward province belonging to “one and the same China,"" and Chinese internet users flooded Taiwanese social media with nationalistic rhetoric. Today, they defend China’ position in the South China Sea, cheer for China’s so-called wolf warrior diplomacy, and support Beijing’s tough policies on Hong Kong.,Chinese media outlet ,quoted literacy scholar Wang Xiaoyu as saying little pinks can be considered part of the ""China’s rise"" generation, who argue the global community is “demonizing” China and that China should take on a tougher attitude to defend itself.,Gao Mei is a little pink. Born in 1992 in China’s eastern Jiangsu Province, she finished her bachelor’s degree in Hong Kong and obtained a master in international relations in New York. She asked that VOA not use her real name because she feared online retaliation.,During her time in Hong Kong and New York, she has access to information routinely censored in China. She has watched historical videos about Tiananmen Square, and discussed the incident with family and friends. Yet she thinks that while the Beijing government has made some mistakes, it has also brought China out of poverty and led the country to become the world’s second largest economy after the United States.,""Yes, we have a one-party system. While we might have sacrificed democracy, it has improved efficiency,” she told VOA Mandarin. “The Western countries enjoy democracy, but they are slow, they are unable to move forward. I think the response to COVID-19 pandemic is a great example.”,Gao and other Chinese who support the CCP say Beijing’s lockdowns in response to the pandemic limited its spread inside China, showcasing the Party’s highly effective governance. Critics counter that Beijing’s continuing tight control over information during the pandemic’s early days has been an obstacle to international efforts to find out how it began.,Gao said she considers herself “a mild little pink. I think the term refers to those who like Chinese culture and support the current leadership. I think this way of thinking is pretty common among young people."",Compared to Gao, 23-year-old Li Liang is taking active actions to defend the CCP online. He told VOA that he has used VPN to leave negative comments on Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s Facebook. He asked that VOA not use his real name for fear of retaliation.,This is his way of showing his patriotism, he said.,As an electric engineer in a hi-tech company in China’s eastern Shandong Province, Li said he will sometimes use a VPN to access blocked content online, but he sees China’s state-owned CCTV and Xinhua News Agency as the most reliable. He supports wolf warrior diplomacy and hopes his favored Chinese news outlets take an even tougher stance to “spread out our own voice and regain our status on the world stage.”,“I consider myself a little pink. Previously, the term had a negative connotation, referring to those who support the government without critical thinking. But now I think it just refers to those who are patriotic,” he said. “As a Chinese citizen, I love my country, it’s a must.” ",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_chinese-communist-party-100-hopes-and-disappointments/6207686.html,"

,"The World Health Organization has certified China, the most populous country in the world, as malaria-free. ,It has taken China seven decades to reach this milestone. The country has gone from 30 million cases of malaria in the 1940s to zero cases today. ,Director of the World Health Organization’s Global Malaria Program Pedro Alonso tells VOA the achievement should act as an inspiration to other malaria endemic countries around the world. ,“China, that at one point had 30 million cases of malaria every year and I would place that country among the top two burdened countries in the world can actually drive down malaria and get rid of this scourge of mankind,” Alonso said.,China is the first country in the WHO Western Pacific Region to be awarded a malaria-free certification in more than three decades. Other countries in the region that have achieved that status include Australia, Singapore, and Brunei. ,Globally, 40 countries and territories have been declared malaria-free. The most recent include El Salvador, Algeria, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uzbekistan. ,Eliminating malaria is a long, complex process involving many factors. Alonso says economic development, improvement in peoples’ living conditions and the implementation of measures aimed at preventing, controlling, and treating malaria are critical for success. ,“Vector control mostly through insecticide-treated bed nets will for the years to come remain the backbone of our prevention efforts. Artemisinin combination therapies will remain the backbone of our treatment efforts,” Alonso said.,The WHO estimates there are still 229 million new cases of malaria annually, leading to more than 400,000 deaths. Africa is home to 94 percent of those cases and deaths. ,Alonso says the mosquito in Africa is very effective in the transmission of malaria. This he says is one of the many reasons why it is particularly challenging to rid the continent of the disease. ,“And of course, all of this is compounded by lack of economic and social development, difficulties in communication, poverty, housing, lack of electricity. So, it is a compounded effect. It is where China was 60 years ago…and, we are having a lot of difficulty, even to maintain the gains achieved over the last 20 years,” Alonso said.,While substantial progress in the prevention and control of malaria is possible with today’s available tools, Alonso says only a highly effective vaccine can eradicate the disease. ,The WHO malaria chief says he is cautiously optimistic that such a vaccine is on the horizon. He notes a pilot project to develop the world’s first malaria vaccine, RTS,S, in three countries in sub-Saharan Africa, has been shown to provide partial protection against malaria in young children. ,He says the vaccine, which was introduced in 2019, is likely not to be the hoped-for game changer everyone seeks. But he adds it is a very good start.",https://www.voanews.com/a/science-health_who-certifies-china-malaria-free/6207638.html,"

,"An executive order signed by President Joe Biden this week dropped a Trump-era measure that barred Americans from downloading TikTok and several other Chinese smartphone apps. But analysts say the order also broadens the scrutiny of foreign-controlled technology.,Biden’s move replaced three Trump administration executive orders that sought to ban downloads of TikTok and WeChat and transactions with eight other Chinese apps. The ,asked the Commerce Department to launch a national security review of apps owned or controlled by a foreign adversary.,Analysts said that even though TikTok and WeChat were not named in the executive order, they were not entirely cleared by the administration.,According to a ,, the order will provide clear criteria to identify transactions involving foreign adversary-connected software that may pose risks to U.S. national security. ,""The Biden administration is committed to promoting an open, interoperable, reliable and secure Internet; protecting human rights online and offline; and supporting a vibrant, global digital economy,"" the document said. ""Certain countries, including the People’s Republic of China, do not share these values and seek to leverage digital technologies and Americans’ data in ways that present unacceptable national security risks while advancing authoritarian controls and interests."",The order also sets deadlines for executive branch officials to form committees to study the risks posed by foreign-controlled technology and to create policy recommendations.,Analysts say the new process could help overcome the legal challenges that set back Trump administration executive orders.,Courts blocked two executive orders aimed at banning WeChat and TikTok that former President Donald Trump issued in August 2020. Another one issued in January 2021, aimed at banning transactions with eight other Chinese apps, has not taken effect.,James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said the new order cleared the legal challenges that the Trump-era bans faced.,""The executive order lays out a strong basis for deciding when to take action, and with its clear criteria for a decision meets the court's objections about capriciousness. The EO puts us in [a] much better place by creating strong criteria and a good process for decisions,"" Lewis told VOA in an email.,""This means that TikTok may have to go through another review, and any decision won't be easily challenged in court,"" he added. ""This is the start of Round 2, and TikTok may not get off as easily this time."",When asked during a briefing Wednesday if the White House still intended to ban TikTok or WeChat, an administration official told reporters that all apps listed on the revoked executive orders would be reviewed under the new process and criteria.,Julian Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, told VOA that Biden had maintained ,. Trump signed the “Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain” order in May 2019, declaring a national emergency posed by foreign adversaries ""who are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services."",Biden is “not revoking the basic framework, which is that the U.S. government should be trying to prevent transfer of personal data to a foreign adversary,"" Ku told VOA in a phone interview. ""He reserves the right in theory to come back and go after those companies or other companies that would potentially be threatening the personal data of America."",Both TikTok and WeChat did not respond to VOA's request for comment.,TikTok, a social networking app for sharing short, user-produced video clips, and WeChat, an app that includes messaging, social media and payment platforms, both collect extensive data on their users. The core concern is that the Chinese government will be able to access this data and potentially leverage it for espionage or blackmail. U.S. officials also worry that the heavy censorship of these apps will result in biased political opinions and increased spread of misinformation.,The American Civil Liberties Union applauded Biden's move but warned against ""taking us down the same misguided path by serving as a smokescreen for future bans or other unlawful actions"" with the requirement of a new security review. The rights group considered the Trump-era bans a violation of First Amendment rights.,Senator Josh Hawley criticized Biden's move, calling it a ""major mistake."",It ""shows alarming complacency regarding China's access to Americans' personal information, as well as China's growing corporate influence,"" he said on Twitter.,Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said in Thursday's daily briefing that the revocation of Trump-era bans was ""a step towards the right direction"" and that officials hoped to see Chinese companies ""treated fairly.""",https://www.voanews.com/a/usa_white-house-launches-broader-scrutiny-foreign-tech/6206872.html,"

,"A new report suggests that Chinese telecommunication firm Huawei has successfully secured contracts to provide cloud infrastructure in emerging economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America — a strategy that could allow Beijing to harvest important and sensitive information for ""coercive leverage."" ,The move comes as many developed economies such as the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and France are banning or restricting Huawei from their 5G networks. ,The report, , published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington think tank, identified 70 deals in 41 countries between Huawei and foreign governments or state-owned enterprises for cloud infrastructure and e-government services, a bundling that can cut administrative costs. The contracts were executed from 2006 until April 2021. ,Most of the deals share three characteristics, according to report authors Jonathan E. Hillman and Maesea McCalpin. ,According to the report, these are: ,Not free: 77 percent of the deals are located in countries that are considered either ""not free"" (34 percent) or ""partly free"" (43 percent) ,. ,In Africa or Asia: 56 percent of the deals are with countries located in sub-Saharan Africa (36 percent) or Asia (20 percent). ,Middle-income: 72 percent of the deals are in lower-middle-income (38 percent) and upper-middle-income (34 percent) countries. ,In 60% of these deals, Huawei packages the delivery of hard infrastructure with services and offers favorable financing from the so-called policy banks — the Export-Import Bank of China (Chexim), the China Development Bank (CDB), and the Agricultural Development Bank of China (ADBC) — all established by the Chinese government in 1994 and each dedicated to a specific lending purpose. ,The CSIS report warned that as Huawei carves out a niche as a provider to governments and state-owned enterprises, ""its activities could provide Chinese authorities with intelligence and even coercive leverage."" ,In response to the report, Huawei issued a statement saying the company does not own or control any customer data. ,""Network security and user privacy are our top priorities,"" the statement added. ,However, part of the concern surrounding Huawei and other Chinese tech companies such as ZTE stems from the , covering matters of national intelligence, as passed on June 27, 2017, by the 28th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 20th National People's Congress. ,Article 7 states, ""All organizations and citizens shall support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with law, and shall protect national intelligence work secrets they are aware of. ,""The State protects individuals and organizations that support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts."" ,VOA contacted Huawei for further comment, but did not receive a response. ,VOA also emailed the Chinese Embassy in Washington and has not received a response about the report's suggestion of the potential for information sharing between Huawei and Beijing. ,Once a global leader in smartphone sales, Huawei has seen its market share outside China plummet since the Trump administration restricted its supply of technology needed to produce modern 5G handsets. And the company's business installing mobile telecommunications infrastructure, especially new 5G-capable systems, has been severely damaged by a ,. ,Huawei has made its cloud business a strategic priority to counter sanctions from developed countries that limit its access to mobile semiconductors. ,Ken Hu, rotating chairman of Huawei, was quoted in March by the Japanese business news site, Nikkei Asia, saying that the COVID-19 pandemic had advanced the adoption of cloud services by global enterprises by one to three years, and that revenue generated by Huawei Cloud grew 168% year on year. ,Jason Li, a research associate with the East Asia program at the Stimson Center, told VOA Mandarin by phone that it's in Huawei's interest both financially and strategically to move its focus to cloud infrastructure. ,""It's obviously looking for new markets to offer its new products in order to stay afloat, and this comes at a time when Huawei is reconsidering exactly how it wants to market itself,"" he said. ,Richard Weitz, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, agreed that Huawei is now trying to reposition itself in developing markets. ,""We know nobody in the U.S. or Europe who most likely will buy Huawei cloud services because of security and other challenges,"" he told VOA Mandarin via phone. ""But there are markets that are undeveloped — particularly in Africa but also Latin America, parts of Asia — and Huawei seems to be making some progress there with its cloud service offerings."" ,The CSIS report pointed out that ""Huawei's cloud infrastructure runs the gamut from small, modular data centers the size of a shipping container to multilevel buildings packed with servers, and its e-government services include document digitization, national ID systems, tax services, crisis communications, elections and more."" ,And there are strategic implications. ,""Huawei's cloud infrastructure and e-government services are handling sensitive data on citizens' health, taxes and legal records. These services also operate critical infrastructure, from oil production and fuel distribution in Brazil to power plant operations in Saudi Arabia,"" the report said. ,Huawei landed on what's known as the , during the Trump administration over concerns it posed an espionage threat because of its ties to the Chinese government. ,In March, the U.S. notified some Huawei suppliers that more items would be banned for export because of their use in 5G technology. ,China has long objected to restrictions imposed or proposed by the U.S. On March 12, 2021, ,, ""The previous U.S. administration abused the concept of national security and left no stones unturned to suppress Chinese high-tech companies with state power. ... ,""The U.S. side should stop its crackdown on Chinese companies, treat them in an open, fair, unbiased and non-discriminatory manner, and do more to enhance China-U.S. scientific and technological exchanges and economic and trade cooperation."" ,Weitz said Chinese authorities will benefit from Huawei's ability to collect data from other countries. ,""This would allow them to access information that could provide what the Russians call 'compromising information' in bad or illicit activities — misbehavior that you don't want it to be released into the public. They could leverage that for gains,"" he told VOA Mandarin. ,As Beijing develops its artificial intelligence capabilities, ""having access to millions of additional sources of data can help them refine their computer and control models,"" Weitz said of Huawei's collecting. ,In July, Senator Bob Menendez, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, , stating that China is developing ""digital authoritarianism"" to conduct surveillance, control the internet and censor information within its borders and around the world.,To compete with Chinese influence in these developing economies, the authors of the report recommend that ""the U.S. and allied policymakers should prioritize cloud infrastructure and services as an area of strategic competition."" ,This would include ""packaging cloud services with support for the infrastructure that underpins them, including not only data centers and fiber optic networks, but also energy infrastructure."" ,The authors also recommended that ""the United States and its allies should pool resources to expand financing and funding for digital infrastructure, technical assistance and training. They should also cooperate to remove and prevent foreign regulatory barriers that disadvantage U.S. and allied cloud providers."" ,Herbert Lin, an expert in cyber policy and security at the Hoover Institution, said the U.S. must become a real competitor and provide developing countries an alternative to China's Huawei. ,""The U.S. policy now is 'Just say no to Huawei.' But that's not a strategy. You have to be a competitor,"" he told VOA Mandarin via phone. ""You have to have the technological competence to build a competing service, and you have to have a willingness to sell it aggressively at terms that another nation will find more favorable. … If the U.S. is going to play, we have to have a policy that will support our bid."" ,

,"The U.S. State Department is calling on China to respect the freedom of a Chinese rights lawyer linked to the defense of one of 12 pro-democracy activists who attempted to flee Hong Kong for Taiwan in a small boat.,“We remain alarmed by human rights violations and abuses in China and call on the PRC (People's Republic of China) to respect the fundamental freedoms to which their citizens are entitled consistent with China’s international obligations and commitments,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA on Thursday via email.,Chinese human rights lawyer Lu Siwei told VOA Mandarin by phone on May 10 that two days earlier he had been barred from leaving the country. Officers at Shanghai Pudong Airport kept him from boarding a Delta Air Lines flight to the U.S. where he was to participate in the Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship Program, a one-year nondegree course of study for midcareer professionals sponsored by the State Department. ,Lu did not specify where he was expecting to pursue the fellowship, and program administrators have not replied to VOA requests for information about Lu’s situation and the participation of Chinese officials. A request for comment to China’s embassy in Washington has gone unanswered.,Lu, who is based in Chengdu, Sichuan province, in western China, was one of two lawyers who represented 12 Hong Kong residents, the so-called Hong Kong 12, after they were intercepted at sea by Chinese authorities as they tried to flee to Taiwan on August 23, 2020.,In January, the Sichuan Provincial Judicial Department , to practice law and the Sichuan Provincial Lawyers Association, a government-controlled entity, revoked his membership. ,In March, Sichuan authorities banned Lu from going to Beijing to obtain a visa at the U.S. Embassy and warned he would not be allowed to leave China.,On Thursday, the State Department also called on China to restore the livelihood of Lu and other disbarred human rights lawyers.,“We condemn the actions taken by the PRC to disbar Lu Siwei following his efforts to represent the Hong Kong 12. We call on the PRC to restore the livelihood of Lu Siwei and the many lawyers who have been unfairly disbarred. Human rights lawyers should be applauded, not punished, for their commitment to helping their fellow citizens,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA.,The Chinese coast guard intercepted the Hong Kong 12 about 70 km southeast of Hong Kong. Most of the activists, aged 16 to 33, faced charges linked to the massive pro-democracy protests of 2019.,The activists took to sea in August after Beijing enacted a , in June.,The interception provoked international outcry. China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying responded in a tweet, ""Seriously?! Fact check: The 12 people were arrested for illegally crossing the border in waters. They are not democratic activists, but elements attempting to separate #HongKong from China."",Ten of the 12 Hong Kong democracy activists stood trial in China in late December. The court adjourned without a verdict after a closed hearing. But within days the defendants received ,.

Fellowship administrators have not replied to VOA requests to confirm the participation of Chinese officials.,Chen Jiangang, a Chinese human rights lawyer who is now based in the U.S. after leaving China, told VOA that the restriction placed on Lu reflects the limitations Beijing is placing on rights lawyers who practice in China.,“I guess we had an illusion that if the Chinese Communist Party would allow scholar exchanges between the U.S. and China, it will lead to de-escalation of tensions between the two sides,” he said. “But as China steps up its warrior diplomacy, I think we should have predicted that Lu would be barred from leaving the country.”,Analysts say that in recent years China has adjusted its suppression strategies on rights lawyers. Instead of putting them into prison, Beijing is using administrative methods such as revoking their licenses or ordering their law firms to dissolve.,“There is no procedure, no way to appeal the exit ban,"" said Chen. “I’ve seen so many cases where activists and rights lawyers basically lost their freedom of movement.”,

,"Large numbers of people here in the dry northeast region of Thailand bordering Laos and Cambodia, a region known as Isaan, are facing the consequences of changes in the natural rhythms of the Mekong River wrought by the construction in recent years of dams upstream in China and Laos.,The dams have brought drought in the monsoon season and high waters when it should be dry, changing the lives of the many in the northeast of the country who depend on the river for food and work.,Moreover, the hydropower plans for the Mekong have only begun, as China leads the dam charge with an eye on both the economic rewards and geopolitical advantage of controlling the key waterway.,That has left one of the world’s great rivers, flowing for 5,000 kilometers from China through Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam in retreat and decimating local fishing catches.,No media source currently available,Local fisher Sudta Insamran lamented the loss of ""the same Mekong River that we knew,” as he tried to net silver-scaled Thai carp, a small species of Thai carp, here in Nong Khai, across the Mekong from the Lao capital of Vientiane. Fishers traditionally sold their catch locally or traded it for rice. There are about 3,000 such fishers from Nong Khai province’s six districts.,“Please don’t build any more dams. Enough is enough,” he told VOA.,Just a few years ago fishing in Nong Khai used to earn him around $250 a month, Sudta said, but now the catch has collapsed, forcing many to work inland as rubber tappers on other people’s farms.,The costs of the ecological shock are being heaped onto the poorest people in the Mekong region and many villagers now eat farmed fish bought at markets rather than their own catch.,Up to 60 million people rely in some way on the river as their main source of protein or income across the Mekong region in China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.,The upstream dams and climate change are strangling the ecosystem — fish struggle to breed in water which fluctuates because of hydropower demands.,“At least 69 species of fish have now disappeared. It has also an impact on plant species -- many of which are a food source for fish,” Apisit Soontrawiwat, a local researcher who studies the impact of the dams and is a member of the People’s Network of Isaan Mekong Basin, a conservation group, said.,Stretches of water turn green with algae which flourishes due to sudden low water levels; other areas go aquamarine as sediment is blocked by the 11 dams in China and two so far in Laos.,“Villagers are not getting any benefits from these dams, the only people to gain are doing business linked to the dams,” Apisit said.,The dams are being built by Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese companies selling electricity in the region, with transmission lines running hundreds of kilometers from the dams into Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.,The operators say they are providing much needed development and power for economies in need of a kickstart.,Conservationists say there is already an oversupply of electricity.,“We are seeing a few elite families and companies earning enormously while the costs of ecological destruction are not incorporated,” said Paiporn Deetes of International Rivers, a conservation group.,The Mekong River Commission, established by the lower Mekong countries of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, said this month its next 10-year strategy is to mitigate the damage to the river.,The commission does not have the power to stop a dam project, though, leaving the river without a powerful protector.,Laos, in a bid to become the “battery of Asia,” has two major Mekong dams in operation with several more planned, mainly with Chinese state-backed firms.,The game-changer for the northern Thai stretch of water was the Xayaburi dam in Laos, which began operation in 2019. Thai company CK Power, which led the construction, insists it operates with a “sustainable development” at its core, with extensive environmental impact studies and complex engineering including a ""fish ladder"" to allow species to migrate downstream.,Experts say it will take several more years to effectively judge the impact of the dam.,Yet, the same water is set to flow through another dam in Laos at Sanakham, a project planned by Chinese state power firm Datang International Power Generation.,If it comes into operation as slated in 2028 locals fear the new $2 billion dam, which is to be nearly 60 meters high and produce 700 megawatts of electricity a year, will be the end of the living river in northern Thailand -- that it will lack nutrients and the sediment that provides nutrients for fish.,Thailand has kicked back against the project due its proximity to the countries’ shared border and there are hopes the dam builders could be forced to reconsider if the Thai government refuses to buy the power.,“Thailand has no need to buy more electricity from Laos as we produce enough ourselves,” a source at the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand told VOA, requesting anonymity.,While debate on Sanakham rages, dam plans go uninterrupted with another proposed for Pak Chom in Thailand’s nearby Loei province which could be the first to straddle the Thai-Laos border.",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_damming-mekong-thai-villagers-lament-river-crisis/6204703.html,"

,"At least five people were shot dead when police opened fire on hundreds of laborers demonstrating over unpaid wages and working hours in Bangladesh. The shooting occurred at the construction site of a Chinese-financed power plant in the southeastern part of the country, police officials said. ,Anwar Hossain, a senior police officer in the city of Chittagong, said that police on the site of the future coal-fired Chittagong Power Plant (CPP) in the Banskhali area were forced to open fire Saturday after the protesters attacked them. ,“The agitating laborers set fire to vehicles and other machineries on the site. When policemen on duty tried to control the violence, the protesters surrounded them and attacked them with bricks and stones,” Hossain said. “Police were caught in a situation like a siege and were forced to respond with gunfire.” ,Azizul Islam, police chief of Banskhali, said that the protesters far outnumbered the officers who were on duty. ,“There were around 50 policemen deployed at the site while the protesters who attacked them were over 2,000 [in number]. At least three policemen were injured,” Islam said. He also said police opened fire in response. ,A junior police officer who did not want to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said, “there are Chinese nationals working at the under-construction plant. Police had to take extra precautions for the presence of the foreigners on the site.” ,Some residents of Banskhali said the dispute over the wages had been taking place for several days. ,“The laborers were seeking a hike in their wages. They were demanding clearance of their overdue wages, half workday on Fridays and daily breaks for namaaz (prayer) and Iftar (evening meal with which Muslims end the Ramadan fast) during Ramadan. The laborers were protesting also because they were being forced to work 10 hours a day,” Aminul Islam, a resident of Banskhali, who supported the demonstrating protesters, told VOA. ,Islam said the clashes began with protesting laborers on one side and police and foreign workers on the other side. ,“Soon, we heard the gunshots from the site of the clashes inside the complex of the power plant. Then we saw laborers with bullet injuries being carried out of the complex on way to the hospital,” Islam added. ,Several doctors from Chittagong Medical College Hospital told local media that over a dozen people were lying in the hospital beds with gunshot wounds. ,A consortium of two companies — Bangladesh-based S. Alam group and China’s Shandong Electric Power Construction Corporation III (SEPCOIII) — signed a deal in 2016 to jointly build the 1,320-megawatt power plant. The state-owned Bangladesh Power Development Board is to buy electricity from the consortium once the plant becomes operational. ,The Chinese company has a 30% stake in the plant, which is one of a series of investment projects Beijing is pushing to build closer ties with Dhaka. ,Soon after the S. Alam-SEPCOIII consortium began acquiring land for the proposed plant in 2016, experts said steps were being taken to build the plant without an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or public consultation, which are mandatory. Those concerns were shared by many local residents. ,In 2016, police fired on a group of local residents in Banskhali when they were protesting the construction of the plant. Four died on the spot and two others died in the hospital a few days later . ,In 2017, clashes between groups on both sides of the issue led to the death of another local resident. ,In a joint statement, 68 prominent citizens of Bangladesh, including many social activists, condemned Saturday’s killings in Banskhali. ,“During the period of the ongoing pandemic, lives and livelihoods of working-class people have been severely jeopardized. In such a situation, non-payment of wages amounts to violation of labor laws and human rights,” the statement said. ,Hong Kong-based Bangladeshi rights activist Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman said, the coal-fired-power plant like the one under construction in Banskhali exposes Bangladesh's double standards while the country seeks “climate justice” and compensation for being affected by global warming.,“In 2016 and 2017, during the anti-plant demonstrations, at least seven people were killed and over 100 were wounded. Perpetrators in those cases have not been brought to justice. The owner of S. Alam group is well-known for his connections in the higher echelons of the ruling party of Bangladesh,” Ashrafuzzaman, liaison officer of Asian Legal Resource Center in Hong Kong, told VOA. ,“I am sure, none of the Saturday’s victims, who have lost lives and those sustained bullet wounds, will be afforded justice. The poor and the powerless people do not have access to justice in Bangladesh now,” Ashrafuzzaman said.

,"In 2016, the Swedish human rights activist Peter Dahlin appeared on Chinese state television CCTV to say he had ""caused harm to the Chinese government,"" and ""hurt the feelings of the Chinese people,"" a confession made after about two weeks of questioning in a secret Beijing detention center.,Now, as the director of ,, an NGO based in Madrid, he is speaking out against China's broadcasting of televised confessions. Dahlin has launched an international campaign to hold state-owned outlet CCTV accountable in an effort to ban forced confessions from the TV broadcasts of its overseas affiliates.,For China's President Xi Jinping, ""it is a very important policy to expand Chinese soft power, the idea of telling the China story well, and for that they need media and they need the TV stations,"" Dahlin told VOA.,""They can either continue airing these kinds of confessions and then perhaps lose their license; or can they stop broadcasting these confessions and maintain their license to broadcast,"" he continued. ""We think that in the end, they're going to choose the latter as keeping their TV channels operational is far more important for them than airing these confessions."",In February, the broadcast regulator in the U.K., Ofcom,,of CGTN, the overseas arm of CCTV, after an investigation.,In March, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said that , from ""a Spanish NGO"" that CGTN and CCTV-4 violated FCC rules by broadcasting forced confessions from journalists, lawyers, NGO workers, and activists for the rule of law and human rights, as well as ordinary people, many of whom had been tortured.,The complaint alleged the videos of confessions violate the agency's rules against broadcasting ""lies and intentional distortions."" ,In April, the French media regulator the , confirmed that it had received the first complaint from Dahlin's NGO citing the Chinese state media, Global Television Network CGTN.,On April 7, the CGTN official website , calling Dahlin the ""anti-China crusader."" The commentary dubbed Safeguard Defenders a ""true scoundrel"" that ""has latched onto an anti-China narrative, specifically targeting CCTV's two international channels CGTN and CCTV-4."",According to Dahlin, ""One of the big problems that exists in relations between Western nations and China is that China wants to be part of the international community and get all of the bonuses that come from that, but without being held accountable to the standards."", He argued that this behavior has been encouraged by the West because ""we have not been holding them accountable."",Dahlin is one of the first foreign victims of Xi's crackdown on dissent. On the night of January 3, 2016, authorities spirited him from his home in Beijing to a covert interrogation center. At the time, he had been running China Action, an organization that assisted China's human rights lawyers for seven years.,More than two weeks later, Dahlin appeared on CCTV., ""I have caused harm to the Chinese government,"" Dahlin confessed on camera, wearing a black shirt and a gray sweater. ""I have hurt the feelings of the Chinese people. I apologize sincerely for this, and I am very sorry that this happened."" Unlike many who confess on TV, Dahlin was not forced to wear a bright orange vest, the sign of an imprisoned criminal., He told VOA Mandarin that during those two weeks, he was confined under residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL) to a cell, deprived of access to his embassy. Electrodes were attached to his fingertips and tiny cameras observed his pupils during interrogation, Dahlin told ,., ,""The thing that really sticks in my head as some kind of trauma is that they also took away my girlfriend and placed her under RSDL simply to put pressure on me,"" he said, adding that she was held in the same ""black jail"" and was threatened with a 10-year prison sentence. According to ,, his girlfriend was Chinese. ""So every day I had that pressure hanging over me."",RSDL detains a person at an undisclosed location, a tactic used on human rights lawyers, dissidents and those accused of endangering state security. The individual's family and lawyers do not know where they are, and the person may be held for as long as six months.,""RSDL has long been identified by experts in the United Nations as a form of incommunicado detention,"" according to ,. ,Feng Chongyi, an associate professor in China studies at the University of Technology in Sydney, told , that China's secret police operate the centers and hold the person in solitary confinement while subjecting them ""to continuous interrogations, sleep deprivation and other forms of torture."" ,Dahlin was blindfolded and put on a flight to Sweden shortly after the forced confession and was put on a travel blacklist by Beijing for 10 years. His girlfriend was released that day, he said., ""The point of these televised confessions is not only to deter the individual but to attack a larger group of people"" by striking fear into those who see the broadcasts, he said. ""When they put, for example, ,, a (human rights) lawyer on TV and humiliated her, the point, of course, is to attack all the lawyers that might be doing the same kind of work."",""These televised confessions are a form of political terror by any definition,"" Dahlin said.

,"Health care workers in Cameroon say they are reluctant to take the coronavirus vaccines donated by China because they doubt the drug's efficacy. ,On Sunday, 200,000 Sinopharm doses arrived in Cameroon's capital. Prime Minister Joseph Dion Ngute accepted the vaccine donation on behalf of President Paul Biya at Yaounde's international airport, in a ceremony that was broadcast live on state radio and television. ,However, the same day in Beijing, a Chinese official said Chinese vaccines provide low protection against the coronavirus and officials are looking for ways to boost the efficacy by mixing them, according to the Associated Press. ,In Cameroon, some health care workers are skeptical the Sinopharm vaccine is effective. ,""The government should have given more time for trials to be made to see if the side effects on Cameroonians are bearable or not,"" said Honorine Aza, a nurse at the Messassi government hospital in Yaounde. ""What is the need rushing with a vaccine to Cameroon on Sunday and asking health workers to be vaccinated immediately? I prefer other preventive methods like washing of hands with soap and water, wearing face masks, social distancing and avoiding overcrowded places."" ,Clementine Ndjock, 34, is the leader of the Association of Female Traders in Douala. She says several local news organizations like Cameroon state broadcaster CRTV, Canal 2 and Star FM have reported cases outside Cameroon of potentially serious side effects after taking the vaccine. She wants Cameroon and China to prove that the vaccine is safe. ,Cameroon Health Minister Manaouda Malachie was the first to get injected with the vaccine. He says the vaccine is safe and is encouraging everyone to get it voluntarily. ,While he says he understands that some people are scared because of reports that fake vaccines were discovered in China, he stressed that the vaccines in Cameroon were taken directly from the factory making them in China. Malachie says although there may be side effects, there is no scientific evidence of a death being causally linked with the coronavirus vaccine. ,On Monday, Cameroon's Medical Council said about 400 people — including 90 health workers — had received the Sinopharm vaccine. ,The government had projected at least 1,000 to be vaccinated 24 hours after the doses arrived. ,

,"A new analysis of 100 contracts covering China’s financing arrangements with nations linked to Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative shows lending agreements that are unusually secretive, prioritize debt repayment to state-owned banks and are designed to bolster China’s position in the borrowing country.,However, the authors of “,” say, “Even when we find troubling terms in debt contracts between sovereign borrowers and China’s state-owned entities, we cannot conclude that they violate international standards: with few exceptions, such standards do not exist.”,Launched in 2013 with much fanfare, , (BRI) was designed as a network of enhanced overland and maritime trade routes to improve China’s links with Asia, Europe and Africa. ,By 2019, China was signaling that it would , in response to criticism about environmental risks, excessive debt and a lack of transparency in the financing of infrastructure projects. ,What had looked like a good thing — improved infrastructure and the promise of economic benefits — left many nations unable to repay what they owed Chinese-owned banks and little recourse through internationally recognized agreements for restructuring their payments.,The analysis, a collaborative effort by the research lab AidData at the College of William & Mary, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and the Center for Global Development, examined 100 debt contracts from China’s BRI projects and compared them with those of other bilateral, multilateral and commercial creditors.,“It does bring to light the fact that there are underlying strategic objectives that are taken into account by China before they undertake developmental lending,” said Shantanu Roy-Chaudhury, research associate at the Center for Air Power Studies in New Delhi. “The terms, therefore, can be used as a means rather than the end if a strategically important country begins to feel the pressure of mounting debt.” ,Sam Parker, a researcher and a J.D. candidate at Georgetown Law who is a China subject matter expert for the State Department’s U.S. Speaker Program, told VOA Mandarin that the report confirms what scholars have long assumed and have been concerned about regarding Chinese loans.,“They lack transparency. They're tied to collateral. And overall, they make it harder for debtor countries to renegotiate or manage debt crises,” he said. “China is accumulating significant debts that look unlikely to be paid. I do not believe China purposely set out to entrap countries in debt, but it has nevertheless built leverage that it can use to acquire important assets or other geopolitical benefits. Debt book diplomacy (also called debt trap diplomacy) is a long-term process, but it is not a myth.”,The report reaches three main conclusions. First, “the Chinese contracts contain unusual confidentiality clauses that bar borrowers from revealing the terms or even the existence of the debt.”,The report finds that all China Development Bank contracts and 43% of contracts held by the Export-Import Bank of China (Exim Bank) include such clauses. Both banks are chartered to support official policy in industry, foreign trade, economy, and foreign aid.,According to Anna Gelpern, one of the authors and a law professor at Georgetown, confidentiality clauses put borrowers at a disadvantage.,“Let’s say a country has to default, and it approaches a creditor and says: ‘Can I delay repayment or have debt reduction?’ The first question from that creditor is: ‘What is everybody else doing?’ And the country’s answer is: ‘I can't tell you.’ The fact is all bilateral, multilateral or commercial creditors need to know how much debt you are exposed to,” she told VOA Mandarin. ,Gelpern, an expert on sovereign debt and financial regulation,,added that confidentiality rules would limit a debtor nation’s ability to obtain loans from other countries other than China, increasing their dependence on Beijing.,Eyck Freymann, a doctoral candidate in China studies at the University of Oxford, said the confidentiality clause allows Beijing to exert its influence on these debt-distressed countries. His research focuses on why democratic countries engage with China's BRI, and how Chinese mega-projects influence their domestic politics.,“It looks shady and possibly corruptive,” he told VOA Mandarin. “It’s the sort of thing you would do if you are planning to do deals that would be controversial in the domestic politics, that you wouldn’t want opposition politicians, or the press, or the public to know.”,A second point from the report is that these contracts require borrowers to prioritize repayment of their debt to Beijing or to Chinese state-owned banks ahead of other creditors. ,“Close to three-quarters of the debt contracts in the Chinese sample contain what we term ‘No Paris Club’ clauses, which expressly commit the borrower to exclude the debt from restructuring in the Paris Club of official bilateral creditors, and from any comparable debt treatment,” the report said. ,The Paris Club, founded in 1956, it is an informal group of creditor nations, including the U.S., “that have agreed to renegotiate and/or reduce official debt owed to them on a case-by-case basis,” according to the ,. ,The debt contracts with China can lead to greater financial difficulties in the borrower nations and restrict their ability to develop, according to Gelpern. When combined with a confidentiality agreement, the borrowing nations become even more dependent on China.,And the No-Paris-Club provisions “predate and stand in tension with commitments China’s government has made under the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI),(the “Common Framework”), announced in November 2020. The framework commits G20 governments to coordinate their debt relief terms for eligible countries.,The official bilateral debt of the poorest countries to G20 countries reached $178 billion in 2019, with 63% of the total owed to China, a World Bank study showed, according to Reuters.,The report’s third point is that cancellation, acceleration, and stabilization clauses in these contracts potentially allow China to influence debtors’ domestic and foreign policies.,The report said that among the 100 contracts examined, more than 90 percent have clauses that allow the creditor to terminate the contract and demand immediate repayment in case of significant law or policy changes in the debtor or creditor country.,“This seems to be using the huge loans of the China Development Bank to safeguard China's extensive interests in the borrowing countries,” Gelpern told VOA. “I can’t say it is crazy or unheard of, but it is certainly on the far end of normal."",She added that rather than demanding the full payment, which the country probably doesn’t have, the lender would use its bargaining power to extract other kinds of concession. An example came in 2011 when, in exchange in deft relief, , and “settled a century-old border dispute.” , , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_voa-news-china_report-raises-new-concerns-over-chinas-overseas-lending/6204378.html,"

China is H&M’s , behind Germany, the U.S. and Britain, and accounted for about 6% of 2020 revenue.,Analysts told VOA Mandarin that Beijing’s propaganda apparatus manufactured the current backlash and predicted the outcry will die down quickly.,H&M released a statement in September 2020 saying they were concerned about allegations of forced labor in cotton production in Xinjiang.,“We do not work with any garment manufacturing factories located in XUAR, and we do not source products from this region,” ,. XUAR refers to China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, home to Uyghurs and other Muslim minority populations.,The Swedish retailer was not acting alone.

It said the ‘H’ and ‘M’ in the Swedish name stood for Chinese words meaning lie and falsehood.,Zuo La, a Taiwan-based citizen journalist originally from China’s Hunan province, told VOA Mandarin that the government of President Xi Jinping is behind the boycott.,“Xi’s government has been fueling nationalist sentiment in China and suppressing rational voices among Chinese citizens. I think that’s true to this wave of boycott; it was led by the government and didn’t come directly from average citizens,” he said.,Wang Debang, a human rights activist from China’s southern city of Guilin, agreed.,“The boycott and the nationalism right now are controlled by the authorities. They have been deliberately exaggerated and promoted throughout the internet,” Wang told VOA.,RBC Capital Markets analyst Richard Chamberlain in a note ,said, “We have seen brands like Nike and H&M weather similar controversies in the past and maintain relatively strong sales, however short term we think H&M may see a negative impact on its sales in the large and growing Chinese market.”,Wang also mentioned similar past boycotts — a boycott of Japanese products in 2012 and 2018 over the disputed Senkaku islands — ended soon after the initial uproar. The disputed territory is referred to as the Diaoyu islands in China.,“I don’t think patriotism is behind all these boycotts.

,"A Chinese law firm linked to the defense of one of 12 pro-democracy activists who allegedly attempted to flee Hong Kong for Taiwan has been ordered to disband, a development that reflects tightening constraints on rights lawyers in China. ,Human rights lawyer Ren Quanniu, who represented one of the so-called Hong Kong 12, confirmed to VOA Mandarin that authorities told him to close the Henan Guidao Law Firm, located in China's Henan province, of which he was a partner. ,The activists took to sea in August after , in June. Beijing Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying tweeted, ""Seriously?! Fact check: The 12 people were arrested for illegally crossing the border in waters. They are not democratic activists, but elements attempting to separate #HongKong from China."" ,""The vice chairman from the Zhengzhou Lawyer Association told us that we have to disband, and all associates will have to move to other law firms,"" Ren said of the order on Sunday. ""If these lawyers fail to obtain offers from other law firms within the statutory time limit, their license will be revoked."" ,Ren was retained by the family of one of the Hong Kong 12, who were detained at sea on August 23 by the Chinese coast guard. They were subsequently taken into custody in China. In December 2020, 10 of the 12 were sentenced to jail by a Chinese court for crossing the border between Hong Kong and China illegally. The two detainees who were under 18 years old were sent back to Hong Kong.,Ren said he had been trying to represent his client but was denied access by authorities. One of the differences between the Hong Kong and Chinese legal systems has been that people in Hong Kong choose their lawyer, but in China, lawyers are assigned to clients, particularly in politically sensitive cases. ,In February, the Henan Provincial Justice Department revoked Ren's law license. Authorities told him that comments he made in court in 2018 defending Falun Gong practitioners had a ""negative impact on society."" ,Ren said that representing the members of the Hong Kong 12 was the real trigger that stripped him of the right to practice. Chinese law requires a law firm to have three partners. After Ren lost his license, his law firm sought permission to hire a new partner. ,""We have submitted all the necessary documents, but the local judicial bureau refused to process our application,"" Ren told VOA. ""They are forcing us to dissolve."" ,Meanwhile, authorities have banned a lawyer who had worked with Ren on defending the Hong Kong 12 from leaving China. ,Human rights lawyer Lu Siwei intended to travel from the southwest province of Sichuan to Beijing last Sunday to obtain a visa to the United States. Authorities warned him not to go to the U.S. Embassy and said they would not allow him to leave China. ,Lu's license was revoked in January for intending to represent one of the 12 Hong Kong activists. , that ""at the very least, the Hong Kong case was a very important factor"" for his travel ban. ,Chen Jiangang, a U.S.-based Chinese human rights lawyer, told VOA that the restrictions placed on the two lawyers reflect the limitations Beijing is placing on rights lawyers who practice in China. ,Chen fled China in 2019 after being warned he would ""disappear"" if he continued to represent the daughter-in-law of former Chinese leader Zhou Yongkang, who has been serving a life sentence since his conviction in 2015 for bribery, abuse of power and ""deliberately disclosing national secrets,"" ,. ,""Lu doesn't even have freedom of movement,"" Chen said, ""For human rights lawyers in China, they are not only being deprived of working opportunities, but they face real danger just by defending their clients. I know multiple lawyers currently in jail just for doing their job."" ,A U.N. human rights expert in December 2020 expressed dismay at the treatment of human rights defenders and lawyers in China, saying they continue to be charged, detained, disappeared and tortured five years after the start of a crackdown on the profession under the guise of national security concerns. ,""Since the so-called '709 crackdown' began on July 9, 2015, the profession of human rights lawyer has been effectively criminalized in China,"" ,.,, Beijing has been using a combination of bureaucratic and procedural roadblocks and illegal tactics to deprive lawyers of their right to practice their profession. ,These , pressuring law firms to dismiss or warn lawyers who handle ""sensitive"" cases to drop the representation; publicly smearing the lawyers, their firms, their colleagues, and their families; and threatening lawyers' family members.,

His administration has maintained import tariffs, voiced support for Taiwan’s democratic government and condemned President’s Xi Jingping for alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.

,"Eight years after he was jailed for sharing news about protests in Tibet, Kunchok Jinpa , in a Lhasa hospital.,
,
Jinpa, who in 2013 was sentenced to 21 years in prison for “leaking state secrets,” had been transferred to a hospital without his family’s knowledge. The 51-year-old suffered a brain hemorrhage and was paralyzed, rights groups said.,His experience sheds light on the dangers for Tibetans who share news about the region with outside sources.,
,
Governed by China as an autonomous region, Tibet is one of the least-free territories in the world, with Tibetans risking arrest for petitioning authorities, sharing images about the Dalai Lama on social media, or exposing corruption by local officials, , to the U.S.-based rights group Freedom House.,
,
News outlets are controlled by China, and foreign journalists are allowed access to the region only on official media tours, meaning that Tibetans wanting access to independent news have to circumvent the Great Firewall—internet restrictions and regulations imposed by Beijing.,
,
Regional authorities also are cracking down on the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and popular messaging platforms such as WeChat that many in the region use to communicate.,
,
In November, cyber police issued , on online activity, including bans on using VPNs to access foreign websites, joining discussion groups, or using apps and devices to share or access information that promotes secession or undermines “national unity.”,
,
,
,
One journalist, who asked to be identified only as Kelsang to protect his sources inside Tibet, told VOA he uses a VPN when he needs to contact people via WeChat.,
,
Kelsang follows Chinese government WeChat pages to collect information on policies, and accesses websites and live stream apps such as Kuaishou so he can meet people from different places in Tibet and China and get a clearer understanding of the situation on the ground.,
,
“I don’t mention my profession and try to collect information through casual chats,” he told VOA.,
,
Though he keeps his sources anonymous, Kelsang said he learned that one contact, who ran an online platform focusing on environmental and development issues, was detained for six months and had his WeChat platform permanently blocked.,
,
Kelsang said the police recently searched the phones of two other online contacts and accused them of communicating with “separatist people from outside”.,
,
“After this incident, one of them blocked me,” he said.,
,
The journalist said he has dropped news stories on sensitive issues to protect sources.,
,
When India and China clashed in 2020 over borders in the Galwan valley – a disputed Himalayan border region – Kelsang received information suggesting a large number of Tibetans were forced to join military training, in preparation for a possible war.,
,
“The family members of my source receive some financial aid from the Chinese government and they could suffer consequences if I filed the story,” he said.,
,
Ultimately, Kelsang said he decided not to publish—a decision the outlet he works for makes on a case-by-case basis.,
,
Authorities in the region can put pressure on activists by denying them access to basic amenities or an education for their children, said Pema Gyal, a researcher at the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy.,
,
The India-based nongovernmental human rights organization, which investigates and reports on human rights issues in Tibet, is aware of at least 20 Tibetans in exile who have cut off contact with family members to try to protect them from retaliation, Gyal said.,
,
Tashi Dhondup, a Tibetan living in exile in Dharamsala, India, cut direct contact with his family after authorities arrested the mother of his child in 2013 for keeping a photo of Dhondup with the Dalai Lama on her WeChat account.,
,
Dhondup told VOA he has been wary of sharing details of other instances of retaliation against his family in case it led to further scrutiny or charges against them.,
,
Last August, Dhondup’s younger sister, Lhamo, , shortly after being sent to a hospital from police custody. She was 36.,
,
“I heard about her death from a cousin in the West. I was heartbroken when I came to know the cause of her death,” Dhondup said.,
,
Lhamo had been accused of associating with a cousin accused of sending money to India. When police searched her home, they confiscated DVDs of religious teaching by the Dalai Lama and pictures of the Dalai Lama, Dhondup said.,
,
,
,
Other journalists say they watch for signs that contacts may be under pressure.,
,
“I use WeChat and other Chinese microblogs to get in touch with my sources and try my best to protect their identities by distorting their audios,” said Gyaltsen Choedak, who reports on news inside Tibet for VOA.,
,
“Lately I’ve noticed that my sources have become less open and don’t respond to queries. Many have stopped responding and some have blocked me,"" he said.,
,
One of them left a message saying, “Weather here is not so good … It may get better after March.” Choedak said he took that to be a reference to increased restrictions in March, which marks the anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan National Uprising against China.,
,
Gyal said that Article 35 of China’s constitution guarantees “freedom of speech, of the press, [and] of assembly” but local authorities say they will “strike hard” against online activities deemed to split the country or undermine national unity.,
,
Authorities already have used new powers granted in November to crack down on online activity.,On February 17, three teenagers were arrested, one of whom, identified by a rights group as Dadul, was later hospitalized with broken legs. No official reason was provided for their arrest, but the Britain-based Free Tibet group , they believe it was for failing to register a WeChat group with local authorities, which is a violation of the new regulations.,
,
For those reporting on Tibet from the outside, silence often is the main indicator that something is wrong.,
,
In the last message that Jinpa posted to his WeChat account in 2013, he wrote: “Even if they arrest me, I am not afraid, even if they kill me, I have no regrets. But from now on, I will not be able to give reports. If there is no word from me, that means I have been arrested.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/press-freedom_sharing-news-about-tibet-high-risk-all-involved/6203172.html,"

It recommended spending billions of dollars more on research, diversifying the American industrial supply chain for microchips and other high-tech products, and reforming immigration policies to attract talented researchers and workers.,Some of those steps are under way. Republican and Democratic lawmakers are now focusing more on ways to address technological competition with China, following years in which officials say China carried out corporate espionage and forced technology transfers to rapidly advance its technological capabilities.,On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation aiming to help the U.S. government develop more technology partnerships with allies to counter China’s rise in artificial intelligence, 5G, quantum computing and other areas.,The bill, led by Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner, a former technology entrepreneur, would create a new interagency office within the State Department focusing on coordinating tech strategies with other democratic nations. It would also create a $5 billion fund supporting research projects between government and private companies.,Last week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged a bipartisan effort to draft a bill investing in disruptive new technologies to challenge China.,Also last week, President Joe , to conduct a 100-day review of the global supply chain used by four key industries to determine whether U.S. firms are replying too much on foreign suppliers, particularly those in China.,“I want this bill to address America’s short-term and long-term plans to protect the semiconductor supply chain, and to keep us number one in things like AI, 5G, quantum computing, biomedical research, [data] storage,” Schumer said in a weekly press conference on February 23.,“We cannot rely on foreign processors for the chips. We cannot let China get ahead of us in chip production,” the New York Democrat added.,Schumer’s proposal is based on the Endless Frontier Act, introduced by Schumer and Republican Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, last May. The Endless Frontier Act seeks $100 billion to spur research in key tech areas, and the new and upgraded version, according to Young, its main sponsor, would include steps to diversify America’s supply chain.,“My office is working with Senator Schumer's office, and members of the administration and many of my Republican colleagues, to try and incorporate some supply chain resiliency policies into the Endless Frontier Act,” Young told VOA Mandarin.,Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told VOA Mandarin he believes the bill will receive broad bipartisan support.,“On the broad issue of China, supply chain is one element of it. But we are working on the broader issue of how do we both compete with China and how do we confront China,” Menendez said, “I think there's plenty of room where there should be a common ground that we can come together.”,He added that he has been discussing America’s China policy with Secretary of State Tony Blinken, and the State Department is conducting its own comprehensive evaluation on current China policies.,“There's a whole of government review vis-a-vis China, which I applaud,” Menendez told VOA.,Similar efforts are ongoing in the U.S. Congress, where several Republican legislators are pushing the White House to maintain former President Donald Trump’s hardline posture on China.,Representative Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, introduced the , on Wednesday, which would continue export controls and keep China’s telecommunication firm Huawei on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s entity list.,“Huawei is one of the most powerful tools that the Chinese Communist Party can use for espionage and potential destruction against the United States,” Steube said in a statement.,James Lankford, a Republican senator from Oklahoma, said that he and his colleagues have been talking with the White House about keeping some of the Trump-era policies on China.,“We want to make it very clear. And that policy shouldn't be thrown aside just because they have the name Trump in front of them,” he told VOA. “If there were good policies, and they were good policies, and they should remain.”,The , recommends that the Department of Defense must have the foundations in place by 2025 for widespread adoption of artificial intelligence systems.,The commission also addressed the ethics of using AI-enabled and autonomous weapons. For now, it said the Defense Department has adequate protections in place so that such weapons do not require a global ban and can continue to be used in accordance with international humanitarian law. It recommended establishing systems to build confidence in AI technology and keeping humans in the decision chain for deploying nuclear weapons.",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_voa-news-china_us-tech-competition-china-draws-bipartisan-support/6202890.html,"

,"Turkey has been a vocal champion for China's Uighur ethnic minority, pressing Beijing to end harsh policies in Xinjiang that then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called a genocide in 2009. ,That stance has shifted in more recent years, with Turkish officials largely abandoning their public criticism of China's Uighur policies, and the Turkish government cracking down on Uighur activists at home. ,In January, after months of protests in front of the Chinese consulate in Istanbul by Turkey-based Uighurs trying to find information about missing family members, police banned the gatherings over concerns about security and COVID-19. ,Some activists then moved their protests to the Chinese embassy in Ankara, where they demonstrated for several days in early February.,Jevlan Shirmemet, a 30-year-old Uighur activist who has lived in Istanbul since 2011, was among them. ,In 2018, Shirmemet lost contact with his mother, Suriye Tursun, a 57-year-old government official from Xinjiang, when she was sent to ""Chinese concentration camps"" that China calls ""reeducation centers"" in Xinjiang, he said. ,""After my mother's disappearance, I contacted the Chinese embassy for help in reaching out to my mother in 2019, but they have been ignoring my demands,"" Shirmemet said. ,He told VOA that police detained him and three fellow activists for five hours recently, agreeing to release them if they ended their protest outside the diplomatic mission. ,""The police arrested four of us including me, kept us in their van and took us to a station to sign papers and released us to our hotel,"" Shirmemet said, adding that the arrest happened after the Chinese embassy had tweeted the night before that demonstrators were spreading fake news.,Shirmemet and his fellow activists drove back to Istanbul on February 23 with a police escort for part of the journey. ,On February 22, Canada became the second country after the U.S. to recognize China's actions against Uighurs in Xinjiang as genocide. The Dutch parliament passed a similar motion on February 25. ,Although now-President Erdogan called China's actions in Xinjiang a genocide more than a decade ago, the Turkish government never formally weighed in on the issue. ,The World Uyghur Congress, the largest Uighur activist group in exile, estimates there are 45,000 Uighur refugees in Turkey, making it one of the largest such diaspora communities in exile. ,Uighurs in Turkey say the recent international genocide designations have further encouraged them to continue their activism, pressing Ankara to take a swifter action to address rights abuses in Xinjiang. ,For Megpiret Ablimit, a 20-year-old Uighur university student in Istanbul, protesting means trying to save lives dearest to her. ,Ablimit says her brother and two uncles are in one of the Xinjiang internment camps, which she calls ""concentration camps."" She said her grandmother was 63 when she died in such a camp in 2019, two years after Xinjiang authorities had detained her for traveling to Saudi Arabia on a religious visit. ,""My relatives' so-called crimes were for either visiting us in Turkey or to go on Islamic pilgrimage,"" Ablimit told VOA. ,Chinese officials insist that Uighurs have equal rights in the country and their measures in Xinjiang are to counter the ""three evils of terrorism, extremism and separatism."" ,A spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Ankara told VOA that the Chinese government has been helping the ""Chinese compatriots from Xinjiang"" contact their relatives. The embassy says the protesters are mainly demonstrating in ""an attempt to smear"" China.,""It's lawful responsibility for the Turkish policemen to take proper measures to protect the Chinese Embassy and Consulate and maintain order when there is a protest or demonstration nearby,"" the spokesperson said in a statement to VOA. ,Turkish officials also have publicly cast doubt on some of the claims of the protesters. ,After the Turkish police stopped Uighur protesters in Ankara, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu made a statement on February 15, warning the protesters to avoid falling prey to a ""planned international conflict that comes beyond the ocean."",Additionally, Omer Celik, the spokesperson for the Turkish ruling party, Justice and Development Party (AKP), said on February 24 that his government has ""high sensitivity"" for Uighurs' living conditions in China.,Mustafa Akyol, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Cato Institute, says Soylu's suggestion that this issue is a ""planned international conflict"" highlights how officials are implicating the United States in the Uighur issue, by tying it to Washington's broader competition with China. ,""[Turkey's] line is, 'Yes, Uighurs face some hardships, but we will silently do what we can, while not confronting China, against which an American conspiracy is being cooked up,'"" Akyol said. ,Other analysts see an economic incentive in Turkey's shifting position on Uighurs, following years in which the Turkish economy has been declining. ,Kemal Kirisci, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, said the Turkish government hopes that investments, trade and credits with China could help salvage its economy. ,""Turkey has also chosen to obtain COVID-19 vaccines from China, creating an additional dependence,"" Kirisci told VOA. ,He said a steady flow of vaccines at a price that the Turkish economy can afford requires Ankara to remain largely silent on Uighurs. ,

,"South Korea’s leading role in high-tech industries has made it an attractive target for fast-rising Chinese rivals in search of enhanced capabilities in semiconductors, computer displays and shipbuilding, among other technologies.,The methods employed by China run the gamut, from relatively benign attempts to recruit skilled workers to more nefarious practices, including bribing South Koreans to divulge trade secrets and illegally hacking into company computer systems.,The recruitment efforts often are highly alluring. South Korean job-search websites are filled with ads from Chinese companies with language such as “living expenses and children’s education provided,” or “two-year contract with competitive salary and bonus.”,“Basically, your annual salary will double,” explained a businessman with a South Korean semiconductor firm, who travels frequently between Beijing and Seoul, and who asked not to be identified for reasons of personal safety.,“For example, there’s not enough talent in circuit board design in China. So, they will post a recruiting ad offering a two-year contract, with twice the salary of an average designer in South Korea. Housing and education for kids will be covered, too.”,The businessman said the Chinese firms generally limit their job offers to two-year contracts. “After they’ve learned everything, they will end the contract and look for other talents they need.”,Japan’s Nikkei financial news organization has reported that Chinese display maker BOE, which has been vying for Apple’s iPhone business for years, ,. These include more than 50 former Samsung engineers who led the development of OLED screens for the iPhone.,Nikkei also reported that at least 62 South Korean names appeared in the patents filed by China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), which is on a U.S. government blacklist.,Park Wonhyeong, a professor in the Department of Information Security Engineering at Sangmyung University in Seoul, told VOA that headhunting is just one of the ways China acquires advanced technology from South Korea.,“In many cases, Chinese companies are purchasing trade secrets or industrial technologies directly from employees in major South Korean companies,” he said.,Corporate espionage is a major concern for leading South Korean companies. This month, two former Samsung employees were sentenced to two years in prison for trying to leak Samsung’s OLED secrets to China in violation of the industrial technology protection law.,, a leading maker of smartphones, TV displays, semiconductors and home appliances, had revenue of nearly $60 billion in 2020. Ensuring Samsung’s continued success and protecting its trade secrets is a matter of national importance for Seoul.,Even more concerning, Park said, is a concerted drive by Chinese hackers to steal trade secrets by attacking the internal systems of Korean companies. He said the Chinese hackers are good at finding loopholes in the corporate systems through search engines such as SHODAN, which let the user find specific types of computers connected to the internet using a variety of filters.,Park said the attacks can be reliably traced to Chinese hackers from the malicious code that is used.,“But why would they target things like customer service that is not key to trade secrets?” he asked. “It’s because they want to penetrate into a company’s internal system through a less guarded department, and then attack the headquarters, which usually has stronger security measures.”,He said there is evidence that some of these hackers are members of China’s People’s Liberation Army or otherwise linked to the Beijing government.,South Korea’s , has identified 123 technology leaks from South Korea from 2015 to 2019, including 83 leaks that went to China. Many of the leaks involved technologies where South Korean companies have a lead on competitors.,In response, the Seoul government has toughened penalties for technology leaks and has listed high-tech trade secrets as “national core technologies.”,Companies like Samsung also have increased security practices to prevent employees from stealing sensitive data.,Samsung requires employees to disable cameras and audio-recording functions of their smartphones before entering its labs and factories. And at some labs, the company uses paper embedded with metal foil to activate sensors if employees try to remove documents without permission.",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_south-korea-fights-guard-its-trade-secrets-china/6202829.html,"

,"For a brief time before Beijing banned the audio chat app Clubhouse, tech-savvy Chinese joined global discussions on taboo topics — Beijing’s placement of Uighurs in concentration camps in Xinjiang, Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests — absorbing perspectives and information far outside the lines drawn by the Communist Party.,Unlike Twitter posts, there was no public record of the app’s audio messages, which may complicate official monitoring efforts, according to ,. ,Only a small fraction of China’s population had access to Clubhouse, which famously requires potential users to obtain an invitation for access. In China, access was further limited because users needed a foreign-registered iPhone. Nonetheless, Beijing moved quickly to ban Clubhouse after workarounds made the app available on February 8, fearing it would undermine their control of public discourse.,To many, that move suggested Chinese authorities felt threatened by the freewheeling Clubhouse discussions and underscored the chasm between an increasingly controlling government and a population increasingly sophisticated at avoiding online controls.,A VOA reporter observed a session on Clubhouse and found the app treated all users equally, making each wait in line to speak, then imposing time limits. The combination, a new experience for the majority of Chinese users, was exciting because “in the process of waiting to speak — users may have to wait for two or three hours for a turn — they would hear different points of view clearly experience the value of listening.” ,Yu Ping, the former China country director of the American Bar Association’s Rule of Law Initiative, told VOA that while only a few people with access to iPhones registered outside China can access Clubhouse, they are often members of “China's intellectual class, and for the authorities these are people who need to be more controlled” than ordinary citizens.,Ping pointed out that any authoritarian government like China’s wants to control information and public opinion. In China, if information is not effectively manipulated and public opinion is not well-directed, authorities see an intolerable existential threat to the regime.,Banning Clubhouse and the virtual private networks (VPNs) that give users the ability to surmount the Great Firewall manifests Beijing’s fear, he said.,June Dreyer, professor of political science at the University of Miami, said Chinese authorities removed Clubhouse because audio content is harder to control compared with text content. ,Dreyer said although Chinese people used the app to comment on current affairs and even criticize the government, authorities shouldn’t have blocked the app even though they can.,Users are going to get angry because they enjoyed Clubhouse, she said. Blocking it will upset people even more and then they will “seek more ways to vent their grievances. Sometimes it’s just better to let people who want to complain, complain.” ,Dreyer said the damage that banning Clubhouse causes to people who want to voice their opinion is limited. ,“As I say, people who have things that they want to talk about will always find ways to talk about them,” she said. “They can be repressed or suppressed, but there are always ways around that.” ,There are also concerns that the app has security flaws that could provide Chinese authorities access to user information. ,The , believes Clubhouse chatroom metadata are relayed to servers hosted in China, so the Chinese government potentially has access to users’ raw audio. ,In addition, the Stanford Internet Observatory blog confirmed that the software that supplies back-end infrastructure to Clubhouse is based in China and because a user’s unique Clubhouse ID number and chatroom ID are transmitted in plain text, it is possible to connect Clubhouse IDs with user profiles. ,Clubhouse told the Stanford Internet Observatory blog that it is “deeply committed to data protection and user privacy.”,The app told the blog that when it launched, it was available to every country worldwide except China. Some people in China found a workaround to download the app, which meant that the conversations they were a part of could be transmitted via Chinese servers.,“With the help of researchers at the Stanford Internet Observatory, we have identified a few areas where we can further strengthen our data protection.” ",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_voa-news-china_china-blocked-clubhouse-app-fearing-uncontrolled-public-discourse/6202255.html,"

,"As the cost of coal spikes during China’s severely cold winter, what is an economic and uncomfortable hardship for many citizens could turn into a hot political problem for one man: President Xi Jinping.,China’s coal prices rose just as temperatures dropped in December, when demand was already surging because of China’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Fossil fuels, mostly coal, provide nearly 70% of China’s power.,But even those with money to burn couldn’t buy coal, according to local media reports, and in a nation where thermal coal fuels electrical power plants, winter’s darkness has taken on new depths. Thermal coal, also known as “steaming coal” or just “coal,” ""differs from coking coal, which has a higher energy content and is chiefly used in metal making rather than electricity production,"" ,, an asset management firm.,Power cuts and outages began hitting swathes of China in early December, dimming even first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Hunan, Jiangxi and other industry-driven provinces imposed mandatory ""power-saving initiatives"" for the ""orderly use of electricity.” In Zhejiang province, an economic powerhouse, the city of Yiwu’s ""power restriction orders” meant local enterprises had electricity for one of every five days.,Several factors are at play, among them Beijing’s reduction of foreign coal to protect domestic production capacity and a crackdown on corruption in the domestic coal industry that has unsettled provincial and local governments, stirring up anti-Xi sentiment.,Given that China is the world’s largest importer of coal, the result is insufficient coal stocks, a flickering power supply and blow to Xi’s prestige, even though Zhao Chenxin, secretary general of the National Development and Reform Commission, which steers energy policy, told citizens in December, “In general, please believe that our ability to ensure stable energy supply is not a problem.”,In 2019, China's coal production exceeded 3.745 billion metric tons, nearly half of the world's total production. It is the world’s top coal producer, and Inner Mongolia accounts for more than 1 billion metric tons, making it the top-producing province.,The government’s target price for domestic coal is in the range of $77-$88 per metric ton, , (IEA).,By Dec. 4, 2020, coal cost $99.23 a metric ton, an increase of 38% since the price fell to $72 in late April and early May, during the worst of the pandemic, ,.,Two months later, on Feb. 3, coal cost about $98.52, ,a government-controlled outlet.,While the price may dip because of reduced demand during the Feb. 12-18 Lunar New Year holiday and slightly warming weather, analysts expect the price to continue rising after the holiday because of the double whammy of increased demand and decreased inventory, according to ,.,China’s ban on Australian coal imports is intensifying the crisis. After months of restricting imports after Australia called for an international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which was first detected in China, , a ban on Australian coal imports on Dec. 14.,A , on Feb. 10 said, “Buyers in China have had to pay steep premiums for imports from farther afield, on top of prices that have risen 84% since midyear.” ,The China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association, which represents importers, said, “It’s been hard to replenish low coal inventory and shortages, ,.”,China imported between 70 million and 80 million metric tons of Australian coal annually, according to the General Administration of Customs of China. China consumes about 4 billion metric tons of coal a year.,Tung Li-wen, CEO of the Foundation on Asia-Pacific Peace Studies, said China's coal shortage is the result of internal issues rather than import restrictions.,""Coal imported from Australia is accounting for less than 2% of China's coal market, and Australia's coal is not key in the Chinese coal market. More importantly, China itself is the largest producer and has the largest coal reserves,"" he told VOA.,“Shanxi ranked first in China's coal production 10 years ago, as did Inner Mongolia in the past 10 years,” he said. “Even these two places are saying they have a shortage of coal, so this is not a purely economic problem.”,Tung said the Chinese government's crackdown on corruption in the coal industry has also made Shanxi and Inner Mongolia ""hard-hit areas."",The Inner Mongolia crackdown on corruption in the coal industry began in January 2020, and investigators said they were looking back as far as 2000.,By February 2020, nine people were under investigation, including high-level local officials and coal industry executives, ,.,Local governments, resentful of interference from provincial and national higher-ups, set about frosting Xi’s image.,Wang Chih-sheng, secretary general of China Asia-Pacific Elite Exchange Association, said the current cutback on electricity have made many people suspect Beijing is losing control over local governments who are “marking their territory and declaring autonomy.”,That would give anti-Xi groups an opportunity to make Xi look bad during this year’s Two Sessions in March, the annual plenary sessions of the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the two organizations responsible for making national-level political decisions.,“The goal may not be to bring down Xi in one shot, but if they can take advantage of China’s energy or electricity crises, and then further weaken Xi's political credibility, or cause some unrest to come down on Xi's political groups, I think that's probably what some people expect,” Wang said. “It is a blow to Xi's own political prestige at a certain level.”,Luo Cing-Sheng, CEO of Taiwan International Strategy Society, said that the anti-Xi groups may use this opportunity to express their dissatisfaction.,“They would just resist for a bit to teach Xi a lesson,” he said. “Basically, it is a bargaining process.” , ",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_voa-news-china_chinas-coal-supply-crisis-means-high-prices-blackouts/6202312.html,"

,"The Burmese military government is about to pass a tough cyber censorship bill that has sparked widespread opposition at home and abroad.,A cybersecurity expert in Rangoon told VOA that China has provided technical assistance so the Burmese military can develop a cyber firewall similar to the Great Firewall that restricts online activities of Chinese citizens. The expert, who is known to VOA, asked to remain unnamed for security concerns., ,The cybersecurity expert said Chinese IT technicians and hardware had arrived at the request of the military government to help the military implement the cybersecurity law to stamp out dissidents and pro-democracy protests on the internet. ,“These are firewalls from China. These firewalls have been sent to internet service providers, and telecom providers like Ooredoo, Telenor,” the expert said. “All of these are … to be operational before February 15.” ,According to a copy of the 36-page proposed cyber censorship law obtained by Reuters and translated by the ,, the law would require online service providers in Myanmar to store user data at a location identified by the government for three years. ,The new rules would also require providers to hand over information to authorities “under any existing law” and would give the state powers to intervene in cases that threaten Myanmar’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity.” If convicted of failing to manage data in keeping with the law, individuals could be jailed for up to three years, fined up to $7,500, or both. ,The expert said the requirements would be monitored by firewall devices provided by China. ,The expert added, “The latest technology firewall has features called deep packed inspection. They can access this traffic, and you can start to see what data is being transferred. So I think they are trying to control the internet with the latest technology.” ,The interviewee also said that the hardware devices may have come from the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, but VOA could not confirm this. Washington has banned U.S. firms from doing business with Huawei because of security concerns.,Photos circulating on Twitter and Facebook show people unloading boxes of goods from a flight from China to Myanmar. Many Burmese believe the boxes contain technical devices used by China to limit online activities.,China denied the allegations. Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, said at a regular press conference on Wednesday that he had not heard of China providing equipment and IT experts to Myanmar. He also asked people to disregard “such false statements and rumors” regarding China’s involvement in Myanmar. ,The Chinese government has extensive experience in internet censorship. Because of the ""internet firewall,"" people in mainland China cannot use Western social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and media and social media software in China are subject to rigorous censorship. ,China has significant economic and geopolitical interests in Myanmar. China has long been Myanmar’s most important foreign partner, and Myanmar sees China “as a key source of investment, diplomatic protection and potential leverage over ethnic armed groups fighting the country’s military,” according to the ,. ,Despite widespread international condemnation of Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya, China has continued to support the Southeast Asian nation, much as it has supported the military since the February 1 coup.,Christopher Ankersen, clinical associate professor at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs, told VOA that the Burmese military government tends to move closer to Beijing in the face of U.S. sanctions and being isolated by other democracies.,“The sanctions and asset freezes announced by President [Joe] Biden may force Myanmar military officials to look to China for increased support,” he said.,Biden on Wednesday approved an , “enabling us to immediately sanction the military leaders that directed the coup,” their business interests and close family members.,Some of the world's largest internet companies are joining Myanmar’s civil society groups in opposing the proposed cyber laws, saying they violate basic human rights and harm the economy. The military overthrow of Myanmar’s democratically elected government has prompted widespread and , there against the takeover. ,The, on Thursday , saying the proposed bill grants the military leaders “unprecedented power to censor citizens and violate their privacy, contravening democratic norms and fundamental rights.” Members of the coalition include Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google. ,The statement said the proposed bill “would significantly undermine freedom of expression and represents a regressive step after years of progress.” ,The coalition also called for the military leaders to consider “the devastating consequences” the bill would cause to the Burmese people and economy. ,More than 150 Myanmar civil society organizations said , that “the so-called bill includes clauses which violate human rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, data protection and privacy, and other democratic principles and human rights.”,The Burmese military government suspended internet services after the coup and ordered a block of local access to social media such as Facebook and Twitter last week to crack down on opposition.

It reiterated its opposition to Hong Kong independence and said that in the interests of keeping the campus environment safe, it would review arrangements provided for the Students’ Union.,After Hong Kong was transferred back to China from Britain in 1997, Beijing promised Hong Kong would retain a “high degree of autonomy” until 2047 under a “one country, two systems” agreement.,After years of anti-government protests culminated in 2019 with ,, Beijing implemented the National Security Law for Hong Kong that came into effect on June 30, 2020.,It prohibits secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, and its details can be widely interpreted. Protests have stopped while activists and lawmakers have been arrested, jailed or fled into political exile.,That fishballs became yet another marker in Hong Kongers’ push against the growing influence of China surprised only outsiders. Many locals saw the move to arrest the street vendors as Beijing wanting to tame Hong Kong’s lively street food culture just as it had at home.,Fishballs are “the quintessential Hong Kong street food and – culturally – it represents the Hong Kong working class like no other institutions can,” restaurateur Alan Yau, a Hong Kong native, told ,. “Street food and the fishball represent the values of entrepreneurship, of capitalism, of liberal democracy. Anthropologically, they mean more than a $5 skewer with curry satay sauce.”,The Fishball Revolution was ""the worst outbreak of rioting since the 1960s,"" ,.,Police estimated that, at its peak, there were more than 700 people involved. Leung, along with many others, was charged with rioting and assault on a police officer. He is expected to be released early next year.,After the first screening, Edy Jeh, president of the Students’ Union, said the documentary production group and director had confirmed the documentary doesn’t breach the National Security Law, and emphasized that the screening is a review of what happened in 2016 from an academic perspective.,Jeh said, “We still stand by the claim of academic freedom. We believe the screening is a demonstration of academic freedom.” ,Tracy Cheng, vice president of the Students’ Union, said Hong Kong's political situation has undergone great changes under the National Security Law, in which freedom of speech and academics have more constraints.,She said, ""After 2019, their concern for society or their critical thinking has actually improved a lot. I believe that when students have some views and feelings on the society, they will be able to make a greater contribution to society in the future."",Rebecca, a student at the HKU who attended the screening and did not want her full name used, believes that the Mong Kok riot was an important historical event in Hong Kong, and attending the screening, despite the school’s objection, was even more important. Although she worries that under the National Security Law, the school may punish them afterwards, she has no regrets, saying, “By all means, I think I should have come."",Another Hong Konger who asked to remain unnamed said after the screening that the Fishball Revolution has had a profound impact on Hong Kong's civil movements, especially the mass protests of 2019 that were, in essence, a referendum on Hong Kong's loss of autonomy from Beijing.,""Leung was among the first ones in the movement. They made people reflect on the feasibility of fighting by force and how much they could do,” said a Hong Konger who remembered the Fishball Revolution. It was one of the first “when they began to mask their faces, and people began to push some debris out to block the roads, etc."",“When you can’t achieve it within the system, you have only two (choices), one is to give up and the other is to fight on the streets, which paved the way for the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement,” the Hong Konger said.",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_film-screening-hong-kong-tests-universitys-tolerance/6201686.html,"

,"While China was preparing to implement a new National Security Law in Hong Kong in the summer of 2020, Jennifer was planning to relocate her family to Britain. ,Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers are expected to move to the United Kingdom in the coming years, where they are eligible to apply for British citizenship. Many of the thousands of newly arrived are now organizing initiatives to support others planning their move to Britain. ,
,
Like many others, Jennifer participated in the 2019 pro-democracy and anti-government demonstrations. But the law passed last summer has Jennifer and others worried their civil liberties could be undermined. ,
,
The National Security Law would prevent and punish what it calls acts of “secession, subversion or terrorism activities” that threaten national security. The law would also allow Chinese national security organizations to set up agencies in Hong Kong. Critics say it effectively curtails protests and freedom of speech; China says it is needed to restore order and stability. ,
,
Jennifer, who requested that her real name not be used, spent months online preparing to move her family: ,
,
“When I came, I was quite well-prepared because I could have everything for me settled by myself, through a lot of hard work in Hong Kong. So, I did a lot of online research and approaching different organization and departments in the U.K. to arrange my place to live and arrange school for my child and arrange my account and all that. Most of the families, they come here for the children's future,” Jennifer said.,Despite never having lived in Britain before, she holds a British National Overseas passport. Her family is eligible to apply for a new visa that offers a path to British residency and citizenship. The British government estimates nearly 3 million people are eligible along with about 2.3 million dependents. Applications opened January 31. So far 7,000 people with a BNO passport have arrived from Hong Kong since July 2020.,Hong Kong is a former British colony over which China regained control in 1997. ,
,
Jennifer now shares her knowledge about the moving process with other Hong Kongers through volunteer organizations. In recent months, several organizations were established in Britain to provide support to people arriving from Hong Kong and to those planning their move. ,
,
Simon Cheng is the co-founder and chairman of one such support group, ,. The volunteer-run organization hopes to fill information gaps and smooth the process for the 300,000 Hong Kongers believed to resettle in Britain over the next few years. ,
,
Cheng says that while there are a lot of questions about the practicality of relocating, such as finding employment and schools, there are deeper concerns regarding China’s ability to retaliate – even in Britain. ,
,
“About one month ago, we did the policy study to identify their needs and their concerns. The security would be the area of the concern. And they were a little bit worried that if they come here when they’ve been harassed, the Chinese authority would be very upset about it. We're not sure yet about the future and potential retaliation,” Cheng said.,There are dozens of YouTube channels, Facebook groups and other online platforms where relocated Hong Kongers are sharing information about the visa application and the resettling process. ,
,
Neil Jameson of ,, an umbrella group helping people enter British society, says providing the right support and information to BNO holders will test British institutions: ,
,
“The problem would be landlords, the National Health Service, the police, and then they will suddenly see these papers they haven't seen before, which is BNO passports. The vast number of people who will be coming, will be coming legitimately, do need to be welcomed, do need ideally to have a trusted group to go to in the places they choose to settle,” Jameson said.,
,
Britain announced the updated British National Overseas passports visa program after the ongoing crackdown on pro-democracy activists by Chinese authorities in Hong Kong. The Chinese government announced it would stop recognizing the BNO as a valid travel document from the moment the BNO application program opened to Hong Kong residents.,

,"With fanfare unusual for a documentary film, “Days and Nights in Wuhan” premiered this weekend throughout China. ,A co-production of official state media and the Hubei Propaganda Department, the film released Friday marks the first anniversary of the lockdown to contain a new and frightening virus in Wuhan, the city where COVID-19 first took hold. ,With shots of heroic medical personal tending patients and empty streets, the film chronicles the suffering and sacrifices of the city’s 11 million residents. ,The documentary is the latest effort by Beijing to control the official narrative and deflect blame about the origins of the coronavirus that has gone on to kill more than 2 million people worldwide, upend the global economy and forever alter whatever most people see as normal in their daily lives.,But one year on, not all Wuhan residents remember the lockdown as 76 triumphant days in which the state and the citizens vanquished a virus, as the documentary suggests. ,Many of those Wuhan residents who survived continue to demand accountability from local authorities about the initial cover-up in December 2019, and subsequent abuses such as intrusive surveillance of citizens. ,VOA Mandarin revisited some Wuhan residents interviewed last year. Here are their reflections edited for clarity and concision. ,China is one of the front-runners for COVID-19 vaccine research, although its Sinovac is less effective than initially described. Beijing is preparing to ,people before the Lunar New Year holiday that begins February 11. After the festivities conclude February 17, the government plans to roll out an even wider free immunization program. ,But there is resistance. ,“I’m not going to get the Chinese vaccine,” said Zhang Yi. “At least around me, everyone says they are unwilling to take it.” ,He pointed out that his decision to wait is based on what he said is China’s poor vaccine safety record. The country experienced one of its worst public health crises in 2018, when a major ,e producer violated accepted standards in making at least 250,000 doses of vaccines used in children. ,“I think the country’s leaders should take the vaccine first,” Zhang said, “but who knows, they might actually be using Pfizer’s rather than the domestic vaccines.” ,Months after China began its vaccine program, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the first , (EUA) for a vaccine for the prevention of ,. ,After Zhang Yi’s interview with VOA last year, he was forced to travel ahead of the lockdown anniversary. Activists coined a phrase “being traveled” to describe the method of muzzling dissent.,Chen said at the beginning of the lockdown, like everyone else, she tracked the increasing death toll day by day. She accused local authorities of covering up what happened in the earliest days of the outbreak. ,Now she said she thinks the government did a fantastic job. ,""In the beginning, everyone blamed the government for suppressing information, leaving us unprepared for such a severe lockdown. But I think they did a great job making up for those mistakes,” Chen told VOA. ,She added that work resumed last April, businesses resumed last May, and in October, tourists packed Wuhan during the ,, responding to government travel subsidies.,“The hardest time in Wuhan has passed,” Chen said, “I think we have recovered completely.” ,Her aunt, who works in a hospital and has recovered from COVID-19, told her that medical personnel have started wearing protective gear again as coronavirus reemerges in China ahead of the Lunar New Year travel season. ,Yet Chen said she’s not worried. ,“Now people say Wuhan is the safest city. You won’t find a single person on the street without a mask,"" she told VOA. ""If you don’t wear a mask, it's like you are not wearing clothes.” ,Chen said her parents remain worried. ,""My parents are in their 50s, and they have never encountered anything like the lockdown before. They described it as a nightmare, and they often say they are afraid Wuhan will be locked down again.” ,Zhang Hai lost his father to COVID-19 last February. His father, Zhang Lifa, was a veteran of the People’s Liberation Army, who had spent decades working on China’s nuclear weapons program. ,Zhang and his father, both Wuhan natives, were living in Guangzhou then, and traveled to Wuhan only for surgery on the older man’s leg. At the time, local officials were playing down the risk of human-to-human transmission. Zhang said that if he and his father had known what was really going on at the time, they would not have gone to Wuhan. ,Zhang filed a lawsuit in June against the local government demanding accountability. Since then, he has been constantly harassed by the police. He told VOA that authorities blocked his social media accounts six times, monitored his activity on the messaging app WeChat and tapped his cell phone. He was threatened that if he doesn’t “stop talking,” he would be thrown to jail. ,“They even followed me when I went back to Wuhan. After I moved to another apartment, three policemen reviewed the surveillance camera footage of the neighborhood,” he told VOA. ,“I am extremely angry. I’m just an ordinary citizen. I’m not a spy. I’m not anti-party,” he said referring to the ruling Chinese Communist Party. “My demand for accountability is a patriotic act.” ,Zhang is one of the few outspoken citizens among those who lost loved ones in the pandemic. ,“People are silent, that doesn't mean their anger has disappeared,” he said. ,“The Chinese government’s narrative that it has won the COVID-19 ‘war’ is conditioned on silencing those who speak out about failings in the government’s pandemic response and abuses committed under the pretext of stopping the spread of the virus,” said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch.

,"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has promised to provide Myanmar with 300,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine, according to the website of State Counselor and de facto head of state Aung San Suu Kyi.,The site said Wang also pledged during a visit to Naypyitaw this week that China will maintain momentum on a number of bilateral projects.,Wang's visit Monday came as part of a Southeast Asia tour extending through Saturday that includes Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines. This was Myanmar’s first diplomatic visit since last year’s election, in which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party secured a majority of seats in the legislature.,It was Wang’s fifth visit to Myanmar since the NLD first won elections in 2015. He participated in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit here a year ago, when the two countries signed more than 30 bilateral agreements. ,A day before the latest visit, Myanmar and China signed a memorandum of understanding to conduct a feasibility study on a 650-kilometer railway project to link Mandalay -- Myanmar’s second-largest city -- with Kyaukphyu, a major city in Rakhine state.,The project is essential to Chinese efforts to gain direct access to the Indian Ocean, including a deep-sea port and the start of a pair of 700-kilometer oil and gas pipelines running from the border with China’s Yunnan province.,Political analysts in Myanmar said that the reasons for this visit were to congratulate the NLD on the election victory, to implement the MOU agreements signed during Xi’s visit, and to supply Myanmar with COVID-19 vaccines. ,Khin Zaw Win, director of the Tampadita Institute, a Yangon advocacy organization, told VOA that China wants to sell COVID-19 vaccines to Myanmar before other countries do. ,“Myanmar first ordered a lot of COVID-19 vaccines from India,” he said, “But, China wants to sell them first.” ,Myanmar’s embassy in Beijing released a statement December 31 saying Chinese vaccines would arrive early this year. According to the statement, Ambassador Myo Thant Pe met with officials from China National Pharmaceutical Group and Sinovac Biotech, Chinese vaccine producers which received emergency-use approval from Xi’s government in June. ,The Chinese government and investors have donated medical aid to Myanmar during the pandemic. As of January 12, Myanmar had more than 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases and more than 2,800 related deaths. ,China is Myanmar's biggest creditor. Myanmar owes 40% of its $10 billion foreign debt to China. It invests in almost every state and region of Myanmar, mostly in the power sector, which accounts for 57% of total Chinese investment. Many rights groups have raised human rights concerns over China’s investment in Myanmar.,More than 50 civil society organizations sent an open letter to Xi during his visit to Myanmar in January of last year. The organizations demanded that Xi review Chinese investment projects and to follow international standards regarding respect for historical and cultural locations, and implementation of a fair border trade policy that doesn’t favor Chinese buyers or sellers.,The issue came up because of complaints at the low prices Chinese buyers were willing to pay for Myanmar fruits and vegetables.,Equality Myanmar, a human rights organization based in Myanmar, was one of the 52 organizations that addressed an open letter to Xi.,Aung Myo Min, the organization’s director, told VOA that Chinese investors “have weaknesses in following the rules and regulations.”,“That’s why we are always monitoring Chinese investment companies with human rights concerns,” he said. ,Wang also met in Naypyitaw with Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmar’s army, known as the Tatmadaw, which is guaranteed 25% of the seats in the parliament. Myanmar’s chief commander raised allegations about the election, which renewed the NLD’s mandate to form the government. ,Military officials said Min Aung Hlaing and Wang had discussed “flaws in voter lists” that made “the election unjust.” ",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_china-promises-myanmar-300000-vaccine-doses/6200727.html,"

,"China’s Jack Ma — onetime schoolteacher, billionaire co-founder and former chairman of tech giant Alibaba and philanthropist — is missing from the spotlight, and speculation about his fate is mounting because when high-profile Chinese figures disappear, arrests and prosecutions often follow.,Unseen in public since October, analysts say Ma may be lying low as Chinese authorities investigate his sprawling business empire after he made an incendiary speech days before the highly anticipated stock market listing of Alibaba’s financial affiliate, Ant Group.,, delivered at the Shanghai Financial Summit on October 24, blasted China’s financial regulators as unreasonable and urged them to be more innovative. He also likened the ,, the global ,, to an ""old people's club."" ,That was Ma’s last public appearance.,On November 2, financial regulators of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) interviewed Ant Group executives and Ma, who no longer holds executive or board level positions at either of the companies he co-founded but is the largest individual shareholder of Alibaba with approximately 5%, worth some $25 billion.,On November 3, authorities suspended the Ant Group IPO. Scheduled simultaneously in Shanghai and Hong Kong for November 5, it was expected to generate $37 billion, which would have made it the world’s biggest IPO. At the time, ,reported that Xi Jinping, president of the People's Republic of China and the CCP chief, had personally ordered the Ant Group IPO blocked after hearing Ma’s speech. ,Later in November, Ma failed to appear to judge the finale of a game show he created, according to the ,. He was replaced as a judge of the second season of ,, a contest for entrepreneurs developed by Ma’s foundation, even though he had tweeted he ""couldn't wait to meet the contestants."", On December 14, Beijing fined ,, which is owned by Alibaba, 500,000 RMB, or $77,200, for violating antitrust laws, according to Reuters. ,On December 24, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (NIM) opened an investigation into Alibaba for possible monopolistic practices, and Alibaba stock lost more than $110 billion in market value that day. ,A week later, the agency fined Alibaba's Tmall, an online business-to-consumer website, for antitrust violations.,On January 4, Bloomberg News quoted people familiar with the matter as saying that in early December Ma had been advised by Chinese authorities not to leave China. Also this week, an Alibaba spokesperson told CBS News that ""no further information can be shared for now” about Ma’s whereabouts. ,While some believe that Ma has left China, Ge Bidong, an economist based in Los Angeles and a current affairs commentator, told VOA that this is impossible. ""No matter how powerful and rich he is, he wouldn’t be able to escape from China,” said Ge, who told VOA he was a political prisoner in China for seven years before arriving in the U.S. in 2018. “If he could leave, there is only one possibility — that is, the Chinese Communist Party wanted him to leave."" ,The German government-funded news outlet Deutsche Welle quoted analysts as saying that this episode represents just the beginning of Beijing's efforts to strengthen its control over China's increasingly powerful tech giants.,Gene Chang, retired professor of economics at the University of Toledo in Ohio, told VOA what is happening to Jack Ma is not just about Alibaba's monopoly power. ,“Alibaba does seem to have a monopoly … but it can be solved through government regulation,” said Chang. “But if the government politicizes this regulation, fearing that private companies pose a challenge to communist rule, the economy will become a victim."" ,Ge, who also writes for the ,, told VOA that Alibaba's online shopping model is not only good for consumers, but also “stimulated a significant increase in physical production and led to an expansion of logistics."" ,Chang believes that market imbalances such as monopolies are natural consequences of economic development, and that it is the responsibility of government to use regulation to achieve the appropriate social balance. ,“The government should come forward to digest or reduce the negative impact the transformation generates and balance social welfare,"" he said. ,Ge said there is only one future for Alibaba: It will be transformed into whatever ownership the CCP wants, and “Jack Ma and people like him will be eliminated.” ,And Ge’s certainty is part of what fuels the speculation. In June 2017, Wu Xiaohui, the onetime chairman of the vast and well-connected Anbang Insurance Group, disappeared from view only to resurface at trial in March 2018. He was found guilty of financial fraud and abuse of power and sentenced to 18 years.,In early 2020, Ren Zhiqiang, former chairman of the state-owned property developer Huayuan Real Estate Group, , after criticizing the government’s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak. ,In September, Ren, who once referred to Xi Jinping as a “clown,” was f,, having reportedly received an illicit gain of nearly $7.4 million, taken $184,500 in bribes and embezzled $8.9 million in public funds between 2003 and 2017.

,"A recent report that Chinese hackers secretly redirected surveillance footage from the African Union headquarters so it could be viewed abroad is part of a larger pattern by Chinese networks to electronically infiltrate key communication channels in Africa, experts say.,
,
“I'm not particularly surprised,” Joshua Meservey, senior policy analyst on Africa at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA. “We know China operates this way all across the world, including in Africa. They clearly have a particular interest in the AU headquarters.”,
,
The , in December by the Reuters news agency alleged that prior to the 33rd AU Summit last February, a Japanese cybersecurity firm alerted AU technicians of the security breach.,
,
Meservey said the alleged hacking is part of a larger effort. He conducted a study that alleges Chinese companies have built at least 186 government buildings in Africa and 14 “sensitive intragovernmental telecommunications networks.”,
,
There have also been recent reports of governments such as Uganda and Rwanda targeting dissidents and their supporters by hacking into their WhatsApp and Skype accounts with the help of Chinese tech giant Huawei.,China has been accused of spying on the AU before. In 2018, the French newspaper , reported that China had installed listening devices in the headquarters. The report alleged that servers in the AU headquarters were secretly sending data to a computer system in Shanghai each night between midnight and 2 a.m.,
,
Meservey said private Chinese companies are “legally obliged” to help the Chinese Communist Party gather intelligence.,In the alleged February 2020 attack on the AU, Meservey said the strategic importance of the video footage is unclear.,
,
“I'm a little bit perplexed about why exactly they would want CCTV footage because ... as far as I know, there's no audio associated with it,” Meservey said. “So all you really can do is track people's physical movements, I guess. But clearly they felt that was worthwhile.”,
,
One possibility, Meservey said, is that China is seeking to build artificial intelligence capabilities by compiling video and other data and feeding it into systems that can learn facial features and other identifying information.,
,
“They're gathering immense amounts of data on their own citizens, feeding those into A.I. systems and then refining them in that way,” he said. “So that's one thing that I think potentially they’re after.”,
,
Reuters cybersecurity reporter Raphael Satter said the AU was alerted by Japan’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) on Jan. 17, 2020, after it saw unusual traffic between the AU and a Chinese hacking group known as “Bronze President.” AU technicians then set about tracing the source of the activity.,
,
“When they investigated, they found that a group of servers in an annex of the AU was communicating with a website that was associated with the Chinese hacking group,” Satter told VOA. “And those servers were sending surveillance camera footage to that website, which meant that cameras from across the AU campus were effectively being fed to hackers operating from abroad.”,
,
,
,
VOA reached out to Ebba Kalondo, spokesperson for the AU, but did not get a response. The chairperson of the AU Commission, Moussa Faki, has previously denied that any Chinese hacking took place.,Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a December 21 , that the Reuters report is an attempt to harm China-Africa relations.,
,
“China-Africa cooperation will not be disturbed by noise, and China-Africa friendship will not be diluted by false information,” Wang said.,
,
Satter said the AU has attempted to piece together what information was compromised but may still not know the complete picture.,
,
“And that's a problem that many organizations, not just the African Union, face when hackers get in, is trying to estimate just what the bad guys have gotten a hold of. And I think that in the AU’s case, they just don't know,” Satter said., ",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_voa-news-china_experts-report-china-hacking-african-union-hq-fits-larger-pattern/6200356.html,"

He also resigned from his position and duties at the pro-independence political party Youngspiration.,Leung joined a growing number of democracy activists and former legislators who have fled Hong Kong after the passing of the National Security Law, which made it easier to punish protesters.,“It is difficult for any Hong Kongers to accept that our home, once a free land, has become like what it is today,” he said.,Leung has been involved in the city’s pro-democracy protest since the 2014 Umbrella Movement and was once jailed for four weeks for unlawful assembly and attempted forcible entry after trying to barge into a Legislative Council meeting in 2016.,“After I got out of the jail, I noticed that I was always followed,"" he said.

However, his tenure as a lawmaker was short. During the first meeting of the legislative session, Leung and other colleagues modified their oaths of office. A court later stripped them of their seats for failing to take their proper oath.,“More than 30,000 people once voted for me; they would want me to represent and voice for them. I don’t think they would want me to leave,” he said.,Nonetheless, in order to stay active in the movement and for his personal safety, he said he had little choice but to leave Hong Kong. He bought a ticket on a flight just three hours prior to departure, not sure if he would be arrested at the airport.,“I believe every Hong Konger, regardless of his political stance, has thought about whether he should leave Hong Kong,” he said.,Leung said he saw no way for him to return to Hong Kong in the short term after Beijing reined in the city’s limited freedoms.,""All we want from the anti-extradition protest in 2019 is that Hong Kongers won't be sent to China for trials. But now, the National Security Law has turned Hong Kong into China,"" he said. ""The government can appoint judges to hear your case. They can tell you that the condition of your bail is you can’t leave Hong Kong without going through the proper legal channel. They have turned Hong Kong into a prison for free thinkers.”,Leung is pessimistic about the city’s short-term future and said he had seen a wave of departures.,“Hong Kong used to be a very attractive place for talents,"" he said. ""Now it’s hopeless. Every month you hear some foreign firms decide to move away because of the political environment. It’s such a pity.”,Now in Washington, Leung told VOA he felt guilty for leaving other protesters behind.,“I am lucky to be here in a safe place,"" he said.

Yang Yusheng, a law professor at China University of Political Science and a resident at the village, started a hunger strike and wrote online about his anger and frustration with the government’s decision. Soon, his electricity and water were cut off, apparently in retaliation, as temperatures outside dipped below freezing. ,The episode marked the latest faceoff between China’s central government authorities and an informal housing financing system called the Small Property Rights Housing (SPRH). ,The Small Property Rights Housing system has been an important, but informal, part of China’s growth for years. ,“There are a lot of SPRH in China for the last 30 years because development took place at such a rapid rate that the law and approval of the land couldn’t keep pace with development,” said Lynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “So SPRH is a way to bypass that bottleneck.” ,As commercial properties developed on rural land owned by collectives, owners were able to bypass the legally required state approval process by allowing local governments to sell small property rights directly to buyers at a discounted rate. ,The system has proven successful in the past, but it carries risks for buyers. ,“Those people who bought SPRH should know that the property rights are not totally secure,” Ong told VOA. ,Although officially deemed illegal by the government, SPRH has been widely popular in China’s big cities where formal housing prices are constantly rising and increasingly unaffordable. ,For the past two decades, when turbocharging China’s economy was a top government priority, many of these construction projects were blessed by local governments. Now, as Chinese President Xi Jinping stresses the importance of green space and environment, that policy has ended and demolitions are on the rise. ,While past demolitions often targeted low-income residents, the latest campaign has hit the comparatively well-to-do: people able to afford single-family homes in the bucolic countryside outside Beijing’s congested urban area. ,Xiangtang Village is a perfect example. According to its official website, the bucolic sceneries attracted “famous figures from news media, entertainment industry and art industry” to reside in ,. The village was named one of “the most beautiful villages in Beijing” in 2007. In 2008, it was named one of “the best Olympic Tourism Villages” in the city. ,Now, more than 500 out of roughly 3,800 homes there are designated as illegal construction projects and will be demolished before the Chinese Lunar New Year. ,VOA reached out to the village committee on Monday and was told that they could not answer any questions regarding the demolition notices. ,Professor Yang Yusheng told VOA that the government’s action is not in line with its own interest to maintain social stability. ,“There’s also no legal channel to appeal or present your case. People are angry,” he said, adding these forced evictions and demolitions usually come with no compensation to the owners. ,Hong Sheng, an economist who has done extensive studies on small property rights housing in China, told VOA that these forced evictions violate the people’s right of residence. He added that despite its ambiguous legal status, the existence of SPRH supplements the short supply of affordable housing provided by local governments. ,“It takes decades to build a community, but it only takes a second to demolish it,” he said. ,Professor Ong argued that the move was to generate fiscal revenue for the local government and cautioned that such blunt government actions would lead to sowing resentment and distrust of the Chinese Communist Party’s rule. ,“These people have quite a bit of wealth; they would not keep quiet and let the government do the job,” she said. ,

,"A Hong Kong court ruling has strengthened calls to establish an independent mechanism for complaints against the police amid intense outcry at home and abroad over alleged arbitrary arrests and excessive police use of force.,Once regarded as Asia’s finest, the city’s 30,000-strong police force has come under fire for actions during widespread anti-government protests that gripped Hong Kong last year. Tear gas, water cannons, pepper spray and batons were widely used by police to disperse unrelenting protesters.,On Nov. 29, the Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, saying the existing system is inadequate for investigating complaints against the police violations of the city’s Bill of Rights on torture and cruel treatment. Also, the failure by the police to require anti-riot officers to display their numbered badges in the protests violated the Bill of Rights, the court said.,“If the government still respects the court, it should take the responsibility to rectify the problems,” Eric Cheung Tat-ming, principal lecturer and director of clinical legal education at the University of Hong Kong said.,“If the government loses its appeal case [in the Court of Appeal], it will have to take some time to come up with a new mechanism. If the officials ignore the judge's suggestions, it will be considered overturning the ruling,” he said.,Cheung reiterated calls for an independent body to process complaints and redress misconduct as well as any false accusations against police officers. Backers of the calls include pro-government legislators.,“By doing so, the government can restore public confidence in the police,” Cheung said. “By the same token, if the complaints against the police are invalid, it won’t be fair to them that the system is inadequate.”,He added that the government will have to come up with ways to address the two main issues the judge has raised in the verdict -- the absence of independent oversight in the existing police complaint mechanism and police officers’ failure to display their badges.,C.M. Chan, a lawyer and head of Centre for the Rule of Law of Hong Kong Policy Research Institute, an independent think tank, suggested that the Hong Kong government set up something similar to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in Britain, which he describes as a “tiger with teeth” as it has the authority to initiate investigations.,“From a good governance point of view, the government should listen to the court’s recommendations,” he said, adding that, ""At present, you make a complaint against the police and the complaint goes to the police and the IPCC only monitors their investigations,"" he said, referring to Hong Kong’s Independent Police Complaints Council.,Under the current two-tier mechanism, the Complaints Against Police Office, a unit within the police force, refers reportable complaints to the IPCC, which is responsible for monitoring and reviewing reportable cases. However, it cannot overturn Complaints Against Police Office conclusions or initiate investigations.,Veteran Hong Kong-based China-watcher Johnny Lau Yui-siu has painted a less optimistic picture. He said, “The government may just indicate they respect the court’s ruling but brush aside any need to introduce reforms to the existing police complaint system.”,Nevertheless, he sees the court judgement as a step toward a long process in cracking the Chinese Communist Party’s grip on Hong Kong. “It will have a snowballing effect in pushing for changes,” he said, adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s purported “law-based governance” is a sign that Beijing cannot ignore the fact that authorities must act according to the law, even though they try to sugarcoat arbitrary policies.,Chan also said he has reservations about how willing Hong Kong authorities are to heed the court’s recommendations.,“We have to accept that the Hong Kong government operates within the parameters of the one-country-two-systems, we can’t draw complete parallels with most Western societies,” he said, referring to the arrangement under which Hong Kong retains its legal system and wider civil liberties than those in mainland China.,As of August, the police complaints office had received 1,895 complaints, including 199 from the media that have been referred to the IPCC.,Last year, a panel of international experts appointed by the IPCC to probe allegations of excessive police force during the protests resigned collectively. The panel said in a statement that the IPCC lacked the powers necessary “to meet the standards citizens of Hong Kong would likely require” in a society that “values freedom and rights.”,In a report, ,, published last month, Clifford Stott, a British panel member who stepped down, said, “Hong Kong police played a pivotal role in radicalizing protests.”,Police Commissioner Chris Tang said the force will appeal the High Court's decision that officers' failure to show their identification numbers constituted a breach of the Bill of Rights.,Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed Chief Executive Carrie Lam has repeatedly said that the existing mechanism is sufficient to deal with complaints and there is no need to set up an independent system.",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_calls-grow-police-accountability-hong-kong/6199209.html,"
Calls Grow for Police Accountability in Hong Kong

,"Hong Kong police on Tuesday arrested eight activists in connection with a July protest, the latest in a widening crackdown on dissent in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. ,Local media reported that those arrested included former legislators Wu Chi-wei, Eddie Chu and “Longhair” Leung Kwok-hung, along with Civil Human Rights Front’s (CHRF's) Figo Chan, among others. ,The police accused them of “inciting, organizing and taking part in an unauthorized assembly,” referring to the July 1 demonstrations in which thousands defied a protest ban and rallied on the streets against the national security law imposed on the city by Beijing the day before. ,Speaking to reporters after he was released on bail, Figo of the pro-democracy CHRF said Hong Kong authorities are oppressing dissidents by filing unreasonable charges. ,“I strongly condemn the Hong Kong government for continuously suppressing Hong Kong citizens,” he said. ,Since pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong Kong in 2019, the city’s police force has been at the forefront of Beijing’s efforts to eliminate the demonstrations. ,According to a , on Tuesday, the police now rank last in public approval among Hong Kong's ""disciplinary forces,"" which include first responders, correctional officers, People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison troops, anti-corruption investigators, and customs and immigration officials. ,“The Police Force attains a rating of 40.3 marks, with 34% of the sample giving zero mark and continues to be the lowest among the nine disciplinary forces,” the organization said. ,Chan Ka Lok, an associate professor and director of the Comparative Governance and Public Policy Research Center at Hong Kong Baptist University, said the low ratings were due to police abuse of power, and the force’s unwillingness to establish an independent investigation committee to assess police performance in handling the pro-democracy movement since 2019. ,Tuesday’s arrests were carried out hours after the United States sanctioned another 14 Chinese officials over China’s move last month to expel four pro-democracy lawmakers from Hong Kong’s legislature. When asked whether there is any correlation, Chan told VOA that “the police's approach is a replay of ‘hostage diplomacy’ in the Cold War era.” ,Since Monday, more than a dozen Hong Kong citizens have been arrested for their roles in pro-democracy demonstrations. Chan said these arrests resemble the mass arrests often used by the Chinese police force in the mainland and will turn Hong Kong into a place ruled by fear. ,Meanwhile, a group of mainland-born, pro-establishment executives working in Hong Kong have founded a new political party in a bid to influence local government policies. ,The Bauhinia Party was founded in May by three powerful executives: Li Shan, a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and director of Credit Suisse Group AG; Huang Qiuzhi, chairman of CMMB Vision Holdings Limited; and Chen Jianwen, chairman of Bonjour Holdings Limited. Li and Wong were born in mainland China and later became Hong Kong residents. ,According the Hong Kong Companies Registry, a government department that registers local and foreign companies, the party seeks to “promote a democratic political system best suited to Hong Kong based on the rule of law and civil liberty with the realization of universal suffrage as guaranteed by the Basic Law, so as to safeguard Hong Kong’s long-term prosperity and stability.” ,But Hong Kong commentator Stephen Shiu said the creation of the party shows Beijing is no longer satisfied with old pro-establishment forces and hopes a new party representing new immigrants from the mainland can help restrain “extremist forces” in the legislature. ,Other analysts say that Beijing wants to put its own people into Hong Kong’s political arena. ,They argue that to Beijing, even its closest ally, the New People’s Party, is still seen as a local party rather than one formed by its own people. ,

Hong Kong Police Arrest Eight Over 'Unauthorized' Protest

,"The Hong Kong government’s decision to sentence three prominent activists to prison for organizing an unauthorized assembly drew fire from several key member of the U.S. Congress.,On Wednesday, Hong Kong pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam received jail terms for organizing a protest that took place outside the Hong Kong Police Headquarters in the district of Wan Chai in June 2019.,Wong received a sentence of 13-and-a-half months in jail after pleading guilty to both inciting and organizing an unauthorized assembly. Chow received a 10-month sentence for inciting and taking part in the protest, while Lam received a seven-month sentence for inciting the protest.,Wong is one of the most widely recognized activists engaged in the city’s resistance to Beijing’s crackdown. He, Chow and Lam were members of a now disbanded political group, called Demosisto.,Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Washington responded angrily to the sentences. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, called the ruling “appalling” in ,.,“This injustice is clear proof that Beijing will stop at nothing to stamp out dissent and to destroy the freedoms and real autonomy guaranteed to the people of Hong Kong,” she said, adding that Congress will “speak with one voice in defense of those oppressed by Beijing and in support of freedom, justice and real autonomy for the people of Hong Kong.” ,Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said the ruling sends a clear signal to the world.,“Beijing completely controls Hong Kong,” said Rubio, chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. “American and other companies should get out while they can.”,He added that the sentences show that the Hong Kong government has failed to keep its promise of a One Country, Two Systems framework, which was meant to give Hong Kong greater autonomy than other Chinese cities.,“If this is how Hong Kong treats prominent pro-democracy activists, then the international community must watch closely for how Hong Kong treats the thousands awaiting their day in court and those charged under the National Security Law,” Rubio said in a statement. “I stand in solidarity with all Hong Kongers who are watching as their long-cherished freedoms are robbed by a corrupt and cruel regime in Beijing.”,Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, told VOA the ruling shows that China has no intention of living up to its obligations stated in the ,, which governed the return to China of the former British colony. ,“It feels like a crackdown on the basic liberties of the people of Hong Kong with total impunity,” Hawley said. “It’s very brazen on their part.”,Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, called the court ruling “appalling” in an interview with VOA.,“What Communist China is doing to Hong Kong is appalling. We should do everything we can to show support for the courageous people of Hong Kong who just want freedom,” he said.,Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the incoming Biden administration would be tougher on China's human rights issues.,“[President-elect Joe Biden] intends to be an advocate for human rights and democracy and it will be one of the pillars of American foreign policy again,” he told VOA. “I think Hong Kong is a prime candidate for the voice of the Biden-elect administration to be raised as it relates to human rights and democracy.”,Samuel Chu, managing director of the Washington D.C.-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, told VOA that he is heartbroken over what happened to young activists in Hong Kong.,“I'm really sad and I’m angered by the fact that the Hong Kong and Chinese government is essentially saying that they are willing to wipe out the brightest [minds] of the next generation just to buy some time to keep control of Hong Kong,” Chu said.,Manpreet Anand, regional director for Asia-Pacific programs at the National Democratic Institute, was sanctioned by the Beijing government on Monday for his work on human rights issues in China. He told VOA that Beijing is clearly trying to silence, intimidate and deter people who are attempting to advocate for the rights promised to them by the territory’s Basic Law, or constitution.,“It’s really unfortunate. I think you are seeing an outpouring of support from across the democratic world for those individuals, but broadly for all of those who want what was promised to them in terms of democracy in Hong Kong,” Anand said.,Meanwhile, Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been denied bail following his arrest for alleged fraud on Thursday. He was deemed an “absconding risk” by the court and is set to remain behind bars until the next court date in April 2021.,Chung Kim-wah, deputy chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, told VOA the court decision is unusual in its nature.,“The accusation was illegal use of his company’s premises. In fact, he lent office space to a foundation, that’s a common practice in Hong Kong,” Chung said. “I think the decision to deny bail is to target Jimmy Lai, and the fact that he needs to remain behind bars for more than five months equals political persecution.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_voa-news-china_us-lawmakers-denounce-sentencing-hong-kong-activists/6199147.html,"
