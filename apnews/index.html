(AP) â Miami Beach officials have spent recent years trying to control the raucous crowds, public drinking and growing violence associated with the cityâs world-famous South Beach neighborhood during spring break.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Business owners claim theyâre being unfairly targeted by regulations, and civil rights advocates say the city is trying to scare away Black tourists who make up many of the visitors.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Two shootings that wounded five people last weekend, prompting the city to impose an <a class="" href="/article/business-health-education-florida-dan-gelber-525f972145f646e2dc05065663899f5c"> emergency midnight curfew</a><!-- --> this weekend, have refocused attention on the glamorous waterfrontâs future â as an entertainment district or something else entirely. The cityâs mayor, a Democrat, insists the crackdown is about bad behavior, not race.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The 10-block stretch of Ocean Drive known for art deco hotels, restaurants and bars lies between areas that cater to more affluent tourists, as well as locals. Many longtime residents have learned to treat spring break like a hurricane: Stay inside and hunker down until itâs over.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-92"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-50">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-53"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-51"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-49"></div></div></div><div class="Component-hubPeekEmbed-0-2-96 HubPeek noBorderBottom-0-2-98 compressedEmbed-0-2-99"><div data-key="feed-card-hub-peak" class="hubPeekContainerWide-0-2-101"><div class="title-0-2-102"><a class="blueTitle-0-2-103 blueTitle-1-0-2-110 overrideArticle" href="/hub/health"><h3 class="title-0-2-102">Health</h3></a></div><div class="columnLayout-0-2-107"><li class="listItem-0-2-121"><a class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113" href="/article/covid-science-health-pandemics-wastewater-9b6589e908c8532db0922cc4ed3f3910"><div class="imageContainer-0-2-114"></div><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><div class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">Experts worry about how US will see next COVID surge coming</h4></div></div></a></li><li class="listItem-0-2-121"><a class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113" href="/article/covid-health-europe-pandemics-germany-478677c6fee399dcd171ebf8cde1fc8d"><div class="imageContainer-0-2-114"></div><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><div class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">German health minister: no &#x27;freedom day&#x27; from COVID yet</h4></div></div></a></li><div class="divider-0-2-105"></div><div class="divider-0-2-105"></div><li class="listItem-0-2-121"><a class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113" href="/article/health-homicide-tennessee-208900696fba7ec95b00b37ac1989dfb"><div class="imageContainer-0-2-114"></div><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><div class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">Former nurse guilty of homicide in medication error death</h4></div></div></a></li><li class="listItem-0-2-121"><a class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113" href="/article/russia-ukraine-war-crimes-tracker-b39137c3a96eef06f4ba1793fd694542"><div class="imageContainer-0-2-114"></div><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><div class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">War Crimes Watch: Russia&#x27;s onslaught on Ukrainian hospitals</h4></div></div></a></li></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Resident Pedro Herrera, 40, said spring break is great for business at the hotel where he works, but he stays away from tourist areas when heâs off the clock.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">âBefore spring break, you can go walk on Ocean Drive,â Herrera said. âRight now, I prefer to stay home, because I know if I go there, something is going to happen.â</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Mayor Dan Gelber said spring break and several holiday weekends throughout the year have been a problem for the city since before he took office in 2017. He sees the long-term solution as a fundamental change in the area around Ocean Drive from an entertainment district to a cultural district, replacing all-night bars and clubs with residential development and boutique offices.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">âWe donât need an entertainment-only district,â Gelber said. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Developed in the 1920s and 1930s, Ocean Drive serves as the center of the Miami Art Deco District, including hundreds of buildings featuring the styleâs signature bold geometry and intense colors. The area fell into disrepair but enjoyed a cultural and economic renaissance thanks to television shows like âMiami Viceâ in the 1980s and fashion designer Gianni Versace moving into an oceanfront mansion in the 1990s. Bars and nightclubs flourished as South Beach became a destination for supermodels, musicians and other entertainers.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">âNow, we have this business model of big drinks and large volumes all night long with tens of thousands of people,â Gelber said. âWhich really just doesnât work for our city.â</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Gelber said he is still pursing a 2 a.m. South Beach alcohol ban, which was blocked by a circuit court judge earlier this month. Last call is 5 a.m. throughout most of Miami Beach, and South Beach businesses have been pushing back against the proposed rule that targets only their part of town. </p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-92"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-50">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-53"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-51"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle2" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-49"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The legendary Clevelander hotel and bar on Ocean Drive sued the city over the alcohol rollback last spring. Though not part of the lawsuit, Joshua Wallack, chief operating officer of nearby Mangoâs Tropical CafÃ©, said the proposed rules give bars and clubs outside the target area an unfair advantage and threaten businesses inside the area with possible closure.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">âThey are pushing for a 2 a.m. ban but with exemptions,â Wallack said. âDo you really think they want to shut down the Fontainebleau?â</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The Fontainebleau Miami Beach is an iconic luxury hotel more than a mile north of the South Beach area. The hotelâs nightclub, LIV, regularly stays open until 5 a.m.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Some civil rights advocates believe city officials are concerned about the demographics of the visitors. South Beach started to become a popular destination for Black tourists about two decades ago as promoters organized Urban Beach Week during the Memorial Day weekend. Many locals have complained about violence and other crime associated with the event, which led to an increased police presence. But the eventâs continued popularity correlates to a bump in Black tourism throughout the year, including spring break.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Stephen Hunter Johnson, an attorney and member of Miami-Dadeâs Black Affairs Advisory Board, said the emergency curfew was an overreaction to last weekendâs shootings. He argued that if two nonfatal shootings in two days was enough to warrant a <a class="" href="/article/miami-sets-curfew-spring-break-coronavirus-4c4ac71405e13f063e38dde30ef260d3">state of emergency</a><!-- -->, then the entire county should be under a state of emergency indefinitely.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">âThe only emergency in Miami Beach is that there were Black people there,â Johnson said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88"><a class="" href="/article/miami-south-beach-spring-break-coronavirus-edd4a28c41892586bddb7616ba42ef78">More than 1,000 people were arrested</a><!-- --> last March, when the city imposed an 8 p.m. curfew. At the time, authorities sent military style vehicles to disperse predominantly Black crowds with rubber bullets, prompting criticism from Black activists. In an attempt to discourage large crowds, the city had canceled all programs amid the pandemic, leaving a void for tens of thousands of people gathered with nothing to do. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Johnson said this yearâs Miami Beach Live concert series, the cityâs attempt to return programming to spring break, completely ignored the young urban demographic by booking artists like 1990s alt-rocker Alanis Morissette and Broadway performer Bernadette Peters. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Miami Beachâs mayor rejects the idea that the city is somehow trying to discourage Black visitors.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">âThe issue this weekend was obviously related to behavior and not race,â Gelber said. âWe had spring break for three weeks without asking for a curfew, without invoking the emergency powers. We did it the morning after two shootings.â</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Many visitors feel itâs unfair to be surprised with restrictions after making their spring break plans weeks or months in advance, but most are still determined to have a good time.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Anwar Hassan, 21, visiting from Washington, D.C., said heâll just find something else to do after the curfew. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">âIâm not going to let this limit my trip,â Hassan said. âIâll just go do something else somewhere else. It doesnât have to be at the beach. This place is huge. Weâll find something.â</p></div></div></div><div class="Component-footer-0-2-1 -footer"><div class="fluid-wrapper"><div class="Component-grid-0-2-2"><nav class="Component-nav-0-2-3"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">AP NEWS</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a href="/hub/ap-top-news">Top Stories</a></li><li><a href="/hub/videos">Video</a></li><li><a href="mailto:support@apnews.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="/accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</a></li><li><button class="optanon-show-settings">Cookie Settings</button></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-apps-0-2-4"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Download AP NEWS</div><div class="Component-downloadDescription-0-2-11">Connect with the definitive source for global and local news</div><div class="Component-list-0-2-13"></div></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-moreFromAp-0-2-5"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">More from AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org">ap.org</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://insights.ap.org/">AP Insights</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.ap.org/">AP Definitive Source Blog</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://apimagesblog.com/">AP Images Spotlight</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/explore/">AP Explore</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/books/">AP Books</a></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-followAp-0-2-6"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Follow AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-17"><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/AP" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-twitter"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/APNews" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-facebook"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AssociatedPress" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-youtube"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/associated-press" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-linkedin"></use></svg></a></li></ol></nav><div class="Component-divider-0-2-7 Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><div class="Component-legalStuff-0-2-8 Component-legalStuff-0-2-20"><nav class="Component-legalStuffNav-0-2-21"><div class="Component-title-0-2-24 Component-spaceBelow-0-2-27">The Associated Press</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-22"><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/about/">About</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/contact-us/">Contact</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://aphelp.ap.org">Customer Support</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/careers/">Careers</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a href="/termsofservice">Terms &amp; Conditions</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a href="/privacystatement">Privacy</a></li></ol></nav><div class="Component-copyright-0-2-25"><span class="Component-span-0-2-26 Component-spaceBelow-0-2-27 Component-spaceAbove-0-2-28">All contents Â© copyright <!-- -->2022<!-- --> The Associated Press.</span><span class="Component-span-0-2-26 Component-spaceBelow-0-2-27"> <!-- -->All rights reserved.</span></div></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><script>window['titanium-config'] = {"env":"prod","base":"https://apnews.com","afsApi":"https://afs-prod.appspot.com/api/v2","gcsRoot":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod","googleAnalyticsId":"UA-19104461-33","googleTagManagerId":"GTM-WNXLD4","dfpEnvironment":"PRODUCTION","newRelicServerConfig":"./config/newrelic/prod","appVersion":"1030","pianoAid":"wwB5UljV1U","sailThru":true};

The CDC will be reducing that program to three labs over the next two months. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The weekly volume of sequences performed through the contracts was much higher during the omicron wave in December and January, when more people were getting tested, and already has fallen to about 35,000. By late spring, it will be down to 10,000, although CDC officials say the contracts allow the volume to increase to more than 20,000 if necessary. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The agency also says turnaround time and quality standards have been improved in the new contracts, and that it does not expect the change will hurt its ability to find new variants.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Outside experts expressed concern.\u003c/p>\u003cp>âItâs really quite a substantial reduction in our baseline surveillance and intelligence system for tracking whatâs out there,\" said Bronwyn MacInnis, director of pathogen genomic surveillance at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.\u003c/p>\u003cp>SEWAGE SURVEILLANCE\u003c/p>\u003cp>An evolving monitoring system is looking for signs of coronavirus in sewage, which could potentially capture brewing infections.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Researchers have linked wastewater samples to the number of positive COVID-19 tests a week later, suggesting health officials could get an early glimpse at infection trends.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some health departments also have used sewage to look for variants. New York City, for example, detected signals of the omicron variant in a sample taken on Nov. 21 â about 10 days before the first case was reported in the U.S.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But experts note the system doesn't cover the entire country. It also doesn't distinguish who is infected.\u003c/p>\u003cp>âIt's a really important and promising strategy, no doubt.

But a number of researchers believe the change is appropriate. They say hospital data is more reliable and more easily interpreted than case counts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The lag also is not as long as one might think.

Another 17 were wounded. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kremlin officials admitted Russian aircraft had struck the hospital but insisted all patients and staff had been evacuated prior to the bombing. State media claimed without providing any evidence that the hospital was being used as a base for the Azov Battalion, a small far-right nationalist group often used as casus belli by Putin for false claims that the Ukrainian government is rife with Nazis. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At a U.N. Security Council meeting the day after the strike, Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia claimed the wounded pregnant women documented by AP journalists were âcrisis actors,â playing the part of victims in an elaborate plot to frame Russia. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Twitter, the Russian embassy in London posted two AP photos side-by-side, one depicting Vishegirskaya and another of the pregnant woman who died. Each was branded in red as âFAKE.â Twitter removed the tweet for violating its rules against denying violent events.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Vishegirskaya is a blogger in Mariupol who before the war posted about skin care, makeup and cosmetics; there is no evidence that she was anything but a patient at the hospital. She posted multiple photos and videos \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gixie_beauty/\">on Instagram\u003c/a> documenting her pregnancy in the past few months.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The AP journalists also saw no evidence that the facility was being used as anything other than a hospital. They saw no military hardware or vehicles among the burned-out wrecks in the courtyard. Hospitals rooms were filled with beds and medical equipment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The contention that the victims were actors and the hospitals were military targets âis preposterous, and no court of law would give it any credence,â said David Scheffer, who served as U.S. Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues during the Clinton administration. âImagine them trying to say it in front of a seasoned panel of judges as if it can be credibly believed.â\u003c/p>\u003cp>Scheffer and Goodman both said prosecutors in any future trial are likely to argue multiple strikes against medical facilities are evidence of an intentional strategy to break the morale of the enemy population.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Russian commanders used similar airstrikes during the Syrian war. Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group that tracked attacks on medical workers in Syria, documented more than 250 attacks on medical facilities and staff after Russia intervened in the conflict in 2015. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The assaults on medical facilities in Ukraine began with at least two attacks on the very first day of the war. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Feb. 24, a local media organization posted a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/City_Donetsk/status/1496877801689038859?s=20&amp;t=la8joI-4k_wxadHp7T5mJQ\">photo on Twitter\u003c/a> of City Childrenâs Hospital No. 1 in Donetsk, struck by an artillery shell that damaged its top floor.

In an attempt to discourage large crowds, the city had canceled all programs amid the pandemic, leaving a void for tens of thousands of people gathered with nothing to do. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Johnson said this year's Miami Beach Live concert series, the city's attempt to return programming to spring break, completely ignored the young urban demographic by booking artists like 1990s alt-rocker Alanis Morissette and Broadway performer Bernadette Peters. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Miami Beach's mayor rejects the idea that the city is somehow trying to discourage Black visitors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>âThe issue this weekend was obviously related to behavior and not race,â Gelber said. âWe had spring break for three weeks without asking for a curfew, without invoking the emergency powers. We did it the morning after two shootings.â\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many visitors feel it's unfair to be surprised with restrictions after making their spring break plans weeks or months in advance, but most are still determined to have a good time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Anwar Hassan, 21, visiting from Washington, D.C., said he'll just find something else to do after the curfew. \u003c/p>\u003cp>âI'm not going to let this limit my trip,\" Hassan said. \"I'll just go do something else somewhere else. It doesn't have to be at the beach. This place is huge.
